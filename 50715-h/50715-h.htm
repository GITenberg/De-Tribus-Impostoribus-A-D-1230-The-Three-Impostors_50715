<h2 class="main">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This pamphlet in its present form is the result of
an inquiry into the characters represented in a historical grade of the
Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite, and the probability of their having
existed at the date mentioned in the said grade. Few appeared to have
any very clear notion of the relation of the characters to the
period&mdash;Frederick II. being confounded with his grand-father,
Frederick Barbarossa&mdash;and the date of the supposed foundation of
the Order of Teutonic Knights, 1190, being placed as the date of the
papacy of Oronata, otherwise Honorius III. Inquiry being made of one in
authority as to the facts in the case&mdash;he being supposed to
know&mdash;elicited the reply that the matter had been called to his
attention some months previous by an investigator&mdash;now
deceased&mdash;but the matter had been dropped. It was also surmised by
the same authority that an error might have been made by one of the
committee having ritualistic matter in charge&mdash;but he, having also
been gathered to his fathers, was not available for evidence.</p>
<p class="par">It is stated that the action took place when Frederick
II. was Emperor of Germany, and Honorius III. presided over spiritual
conditions; but this Pope, according to <i>Haydn&rsquo;s Dictionary of
Dates</i>, reigned 1216&ndash;1227, and the dissertation on the
pamphlet names Gregory IX., successor to Honorius, (1227&ndash;1241) as
the Pope against whom the treatise was written. The infamous book
mentioned in the representation no one <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>seemed to have any knowledge
of. Inquiry made concerning the treatise at various libraries supposed
to possess it, and of various individuals who might know something of
it, elicited but the information that it was purely
&ldquo;legendary,&rdquo; that, &ldquo;it had no existence except by
title,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;it was an item of literature entirely
lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Having been a book collector and a close reader of book
catalogs for over twenty-five years, I had never noted any copy offered
for sale, but a friend with the same mania for books, had seen a copy
mentioned in a German catalog, and being interested in &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">de tribus Impostoribus</i>&rdquo; for reasons herein mentioned,
had sent for and procured the same&mdash;an edition of a Latin version
compiled from a Ms. 1598, with a foreword in German. The German was
familiar to him, but the Latin was not available.</p>
<p class="par">About the same time I found in a catalog of a
correspondent of mine at London, a book entitled &ldquo;<span class=
"sc" lang="fr">Les Trois Imposteurs</span>. <i lang="la">De Tribus
Impostoribus et dissertation sur le livre des Trois Imposteurs, sm.
4to. Saec. XVIII.</i>,&rdquo; and succeeded in purchasing it.</p>
<p class="par">The manuscript is well written, and apparently by two
different hands, which would be probable from the facts set forth in
the &ldquo;Dissertation.&rdquo; A copy of the translation from the
Latin is probably deposited in the library of Duke Eugene de Subaudio
as set forth in the colophon at end of the manuscript.</p>
<p class="par">The manuscript is written in the French of the period,
and is dated in the colophon as 1716. The discovery of the original
Latin document is mentioned in the &ldquo;Dissertation&rdquo; as about
1706. It has been annotated by another hand, as shown by foot notes,
and several inserted sheets containing notes in still another
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>hand, were written evidently about 1746, as one of
the sheets is a portion of a letter postmarked <i lang="fr">4e Aout</i>
in latter year.</p>
<p class="par">I append a bibliography from <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e261" title="Source: Werner&rsquo;s">Weller&rsquo;s</span> Latin
reprint of 1598 which will show that the pamphlet has &ldquo;been done
before&rdquo;; but it will be noted that English versions are not so
plenty as those in other tongues, and but one is known to have been
printed in the United States.</p>
<p class="par">I must acknowledge my indebtedness to <span lang=
"la">Doctissimus vir Harpocrates</span>, Col. F. Montrose, and Maj.
Otto Kay for valued assistance in languages with which I am not
thoroughly familiar, and also to Mr. David Hutcheson, of the Library of
Congress, for favors granted.</p>
<p class="par">Ample apologies will be found for the treatise in the
several introductions quoted from various editions, and those fond of
literary curiosities will certainly be gratified by its appearance in
the twentieth century.</p>

<h2 class="main">BIBLIOGRAPHY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In 1846, Emil Weller published &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">De Tribus Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; and also a later edition in
1876, at Heilbronn, from a Latin copy of one of the only four known to
be in existence and printed in 1598. The copy from which it was taken,
consisting of title and forty-six leaves, quarto, is at the Royal
Library at Dresden, and was purchased for one hundred gulden.</p>
<p class="par">The other three, according to Ebert in his
&ldquo;Bibliographical Lexicon,&rdquo; are as follows: one in the Royal
Library at Paris, one in the Crevanna Library and the other in the
library of Renouard.</p>
<p class="par">An edition was published at Rackau, in Germany, in 1598,
and Thomas Campanella (1636), in his &ldquo;<i lang="la">Atheismus
Triumphatus</i>,&rdquo; gives the year of its first publication as
1538.</p>
<p class="par">Florimond Raimond (otherwise Louis Richeome,) claims to
have seen a copy owned by his teacher, Peter Ramus, who died in
1572.</p>
<p class="par">All the talk of theological critics that the booklet was
first printed in the seventeenth century, is made out of whole
cloth.</p>
<p class="par">There is nothing modern about the edition of 1598. It
may be compared, for example, with Martin Wittel&rsquo;s print of the
last decade of the sixteenth century, by which it is claimed that it
could not have been printed then, as the paper and printing of that
period closely resembles that of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p class="par">With the exception of the religious myths, few
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>writings of the dark ages have had as many
hypotheses advanced in regard to origin as there have been regarding
this one.</p>
<p class="par">According to John Brand it had been printed at Krakau,
according to others, in Italy or Hungary as a translation of an Arabic
original existing somewhere in France.</p>
<p class="par">William Postel mentions a tract &ldquo;<i lang="la">de
Tribus Prophetis</i>,&rdquo; and gives Michael Servetus, a Spanish
doctor, as the author.</p>
<p class="par">The Capuchin Monk Joly, in Vol. III of his
&ldquo;Conference of Mysteries,&rdquo; assures us that the Huguenot,
Nic. Barnaud, in 1612, on account of an issue of &ldquo;<i lang="la">de
Tribus Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; was excommunicated as its author.</p>
<p class="par">Johann Mueller, in his &ldquo;<span lang="de">Besiegten
Atheismus</span>,&rdquo; (Conquered <span class="corr" id="xd21e318"
title="Source: Atheist">Atheism</span>), mentions a certain Nachtigal
who published at Hague, in 1614, &ldquo;<i lang="la">De Trib.
Imp.</i>,&rdquo; and was therefore exiled.</p>
<p class="par">Mosheim and Rousset accuse Frederick II as the author
with the assistance of his Chancellor, Petrus de Vineis. Vineis,
however, declares himself opposed even to the fundamental principles of
the book, and in his &ldquo;<i lang="la">Epist. Lib. 1, ch. 31, p.
211</i>,&rdquo; says he never had any idea of it.</p>
<p class="par">Others place the authorship with Averroes, Peter Arretin
and Petrus Pomponatius. Heinrich Ernst accuses the above mentioned
Postel. Postel attributes it to Servetus, who, in turn, places it at
the door of the Huguenot Barnaud.</p>
<p class="par">The instigator of the treatise, it is claimed, should
have been Julius Cesar Vanini, who was burned at Toulouse in 1619, or
Ryswick, who suffered at the stake in Rome in 1612. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Other persons accused of the authorship are
Macchiavelli, Rabelais, Erasmus, Milton (John, born 1608,) a Mahometan
named Merula, Dolet, and Giordano Bruno.</p>
<p class="par">According to Campanella, to whom the authorship was
attributed occasionally, Muret, or Joh. Franz. Poggio, were
responsible. Browne says it was Bernhard Ochini, and Maresius lays it
to Johann Boccaccio.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;three cheats&rdquo; are Moses, Jesus and
Mahomet, but the tracts of each of the latter alleged authors treat
only of Moses, of whom they say that his assertions in Genesis will not
hold water, and cannot be proved.</p>
<p class="par">Weller, in his edition of 1876, speaking of the copy of
1598, says that this issue should never be compared with any of the
foregoing.</p>
<p class="par">Many authors have written &ldquo;<i lang="la">de Tribus
Impostoribus</i>&rdquo; because they had some special object in view;
for instance, John Bapt. Morinus, when he edited, under the name of
Vincentius Panurgius, in Paris, 1654, an argument against
Gassendi<span class="corr" id="xd21e347" title="Source: .">,</span>
Neure, and Bernier.</p>
<p class="par">Joh. Evelyn with a &ldquo;<i lang="la">Historia de
tribus hujus <span class="corr" id="xd21e354" title=
"Source: se culi">seculi</span> famosis Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; Padre
Ottomano, Mahomed Bei, otherwise Joh. Mich. Cigala, and Sabbatai Sevi
(English 1680, German 1669,)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e358src" href=

&ldquo;<i lang="la">de Tribus Impostoribus Magnus</i>,&rdquo; (Kiel
1680 and Hamburg 1701,) against Herbert, Hobbes and Spinosa, Hadrian
Beverland, Perini del Vago, Equitis de Malta, &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Epistolium ad Batavum in Brittania hospitem de tribus
Impostoribus</i>,<span class="corr" id="xd21e393" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> (Latin and English 1709.)</p>
<p class="par">Finally, Michael Alberti, under the name of Andronicus,
published a &ldquo;<i lang="la">Tractatus Medico-historicus de tribus
Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; which he named the three great Tempters of
Humanity: 1. Tea and Coffee. 2. Laziness. 3. Home apothecaries.</p>
<p class="par">Cosmopoli Bey (Peter Martin Roman), issued at Russworn
in Rostock in 1731, and a new edition of same treatise&mdash;<i lang=
"la">De Trib. Imp.</i>&mdash;1738 and 1756.</p>
<p class="par">For a long time scholars confused the genuine Latin
treatise with a later one. De la Monnoye fabricated a long dissertation
in which he denied the existence of the original Latin edition, but
received a well merited refutation at the hands of P. F. Arpe.</p>
<p class="par">The false book is French&mdash;&ldquo;<i lang="fr">La
vie et l&rsquo;esprit de Mr. Benoit Spinoza</i>.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e414src" href="#xd21e414" name="xd21e414src">2</a>
The author of the first part <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=
"#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>was Hofrath Vroes, in Hague, and the
second was written by Dr. Lucas. It made its first appearance at Hague
1719, and later in 1721, under the title &ldquo;<i lang="la">de Tribus
Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; <i lang="fr">des Trois Imposteurs</i>.
Frankfort-on-the-Main at the expense of the Translator (<i>i. e.</i>
Rotterdam.)</p>
<p class="par">Richard la Selve prepared a third edition under the
original title of &ldquo;The Life of Spinoza,&rdquo; by one of his
Disciples. Hamburgh (really in Holland,) 1735.</p>
<p class="par">In 1768 there was printed by M. M. Rey, at Amsterdam, a
new edition called a &ldquo;Treatise of the Three Impostors;&rdquo;
immediately after another edition appeared at Yverdoner 1768, another
in Holland 1775, and a later one in Germany 1777.</p>
<p class="par">The contents of &ldquo;<span lang="fr">L&rsquo;esprit de
Spinoza</span>&rdquo; (German) by Spinoza II, or Subiroth
Sopim&mdash;Rome, by Widow Bona Spes 5770&mdash;(Vieweg in Berlin
1787,) are briefly Chap. I, Concerning God. Chap. II, Reasons why men
have created an invisible Being which is commonly called God. Chap.
III, What the word Religion signifies, and how and why so many of these
Religions have crept into the world. Chap. IV, Evident truths. Chap. V,
Of the Soul. Chap. VI, Of Ghosts, Demons, etc. Then follows fifteen
chapters which are not in the treatise (? Edition 1598.) <span class=

<p class="par first">The Translator of the following little treatise
deems it necessary to say a few words as to the object of its
publication. It is given to the world, neither with a view to advocate
Scepticism, nor to spread Infidelity, but simply to vindicate the right
of private judgment. No human being is in a position to look into the
heart, or to decide correctly as to the creed or conduct of his fellow
mortals; and the attributes of the Deity are so far beyond the grasp of
limited reason, that man must become a God himself before he can
comprehend them. Such being the case, surely all harsh censure of each
other&rsquo;s opinions and actions ought to be abandoned; and every one
should so train himself as to be enabled to declare with the humane and
manly philosopher</p>

DISRAELI&rsquo;S CURIOSITIES OF LITERATURE.</p>
<p class="par footnote xd21e215">Title, &ldquo;Literary
Forgeries.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote">&ldquo;The Duc de la Valliere and the Abbe de
St. Leger, once concerted together to supply the eager purchaser of
literary rarities with a copy of &ldquo;De Tribus Impostoribus,&rdquo;
a book, by the date, pretended to have been printed in 1598, though
probably a modern forgery of 1698. The title of such a book had long
existed by rumor, but never was a copy seen by man. Works printed with
this title have all been proved to be modern fabrications&mdash;a copy
however of the &lsquo;<span lang="fr">introuvable</span>&rsquo;
original was sold at the Duc de la Valliere&rsquo;s sale. The history
of this volume is curious. The Duc and the Abbe having manufactured a
text had it printed in the old Gothic character, under the title
&lsquo;<span lang="la">De Tribus Impostoribus</span>.&rsquo; They
proposed to put the great bibliopobet, De Bure, in good humor, whose
agency would sanction the imposition. They were afterwards to dole out
copies at 25 louis each, which would have been a reasonable price for a
book which no one ever saw! They invited De Bure to dinner, flattered
and cajoled him, and, as they imagined at the moment they had wound him
up to their pitch, they exhibited their manufacture&mdash;the keen-eyed
glance of the renowned cataloguer of the &lsquo;<span lang=
"fr">Bibliographie Instructive</span>&rsquo; instantly shot like
lightning over it, and like lightning, destroyed the whole edition. He
not only discovered the forgery but reprobated it! He refused his
sanction; and the forging Duc and Abbe, in confusion suppressed the
&lsquo;<span lang="fr">livre introuvable</span>&rsquo;; but they owed a
grudge to the honest bibliographer and attempted to write down the work
whence the De Bures derive their fame.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

the <i>printing</i> of the book they can bring forward no <i>proof</i>
whatever of its having being done prior to this date (1716) and it is
impossible to conceive that Frederick, surrounded as he was by enemies,
would have circulated a work which gave a fair opportunity of
proclaiming his infidelity. It is probable therefore that there were
only two copies, the original one and that sent to Otho of Bavaria. J.

it in his girdle labelled, &ldquo;The Theological Stylus,&rdquo; or Pen
of the Church. The trenchant powers of this instrument have more
frequently been employed to repress truth, than to refute

<h2 class="main">DISSERTATION ON THE BOOK OF THE THREE IMPOSTORS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">More than four hundred years have elapsed since
this little treatise was first mentioned, the title of which has always
caused it to be qualified as impious, profane and worthy of the fire. I
am convinced that none of those who have mentioned it have read it, and
after having examined it carefully, it can only be said that it is
written with as much discretion as the matter would allow to a man
persuaded of the falsehood of the things which he attacked, and
protected by a powerful prince, under whose direction he wrote.</p>
<p class="par">There have been but few scholars whose religious beliefs
were dubious, who have not been credited with the authorship of this
treatise.</p>
<p class="par"><i><span class="corr" id="xd21e1253" title=
"Source: Avervoes">Averroes</span></i>, a famous Arabian commentator on
Aristotle&rsquo;s works, and celebrated for his learning, was the first
to whom this production was attributed. He lived about the middle of
the twelfth century when the &ldquo;three impostors&rdquo; were first
spoken of. He was not a Christian, as he treated their religion as
&ldquo;the Impossible,&rdquo; nor a Jew, whose law he called &ldquo;a
Religion for Children,&rdquo; nor a Mahometan, for he denominated their
belief &ldquo;a Religion for Hogs.&rdquo; He finally died a
Philosopher, that is to say, without having subscribed to the opinions
of the vulgar, and that was sufficient to publish him as the enemy of
the law makers of the three Religions that he had scorned.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Jean Bocala</i>, an Italian scholar of a happy
disposition, and consequently not much imbued with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name="pb27">27</a>]</span>bigotry,
flourished in the middle of the fourteenth century. A fable that he
ventured in one of his works, concerning &ldquo;Three Rings,&rdquo; has
been regarded as evidence of this execrable book whose author was
looked for, and this was considered sufficient to attribute the
authorship to him long after his death.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Michael Servetus</i>, burned at Geneva (1553) by the
pitiless persecution of <i>Mr. John Calvin</i>, he not having
subscribed <span class="corr" id="xd21e1269" title=
"Not in source">to</span> either the Trinity or the Redeemer, it became
proper to attribute to him the production of this impious volume.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Etienne Dolit</i>, a printer at Paris, and who ranked
among the learned, was led to the stake&mdash;to which he had been
condemned as a Calvinist in 1543&mdash;with a courage comparable to
that of the first martyrs. He therefore merited to be treated as an
atheist, and was honored as the author of the pamphlet against the
&ldquo;Three Impostors.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par"><i>Lucilio Vanini</i>, a Neapolitan, and the most noted
atheist of his time, if his enemies may be believed, fairly proved
before his judges&mdash;however he may have been convinced&mdash;the
truth of a Providence, and consequently a God. It sufficed however for
the persecution of his enemies, the Parliament of Toulouse, who
condemned him to be burned as an atheist, and also to merit the
distinction of having composed, or at least having revived, the book in
question.</p>
<p class="par">I am not sure but what <i>Ochini</i> and <i>Postel</i>,
<i>Pomponiac</i> and <i>Poggio</i> the Florentine, and
<i>Campanella</i>, all celebrated for some particular opinion condemned
by the Church of their time, were for that reason accused as atheists,
and also adjudged without trouble, the authors of the little truth for
whom a parent was sought. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=
"#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">All that famous critics have published from time to time
of this book has excited the curiosity of the great and wise to
determine the author, but without avail.</p>
<p class="par">I believe that several treatises printed with the title
&ldquo;<i lang="la">de Tribus Impostoribus</i>,&rdquo; such as that of
<i>Kortholt</i> against <i>Spinosa</i>, <i>Hobbes</i> and the <i>Baron
Cherbourg</i>; that of the false <i>Panurge</i> against <i lang=
"fr">Messieurs Gastardi</i>, <i>de Neure</i> and <i>Bernier</i> have
furnished many opportunities for an infinity of half-scholars who only
speak from hearsay, and who often judge a book by the first line of the
title. I have, like many others who have examined this work, done so in
a superficial manner. Though I am a delver in antiquities, and a
decipherer of manuscript, chance having caused the pamphlet to fall
into my hands at one time, I avow that I gave neither thought to the
production nor to its author.</p>
<p class="par">Some business affairs having taken me to
<i>Frankfort-on-the-Main</i> about the month of April, (1706), that is
about fifteen days after the Fair, I called on a friend named
<i>Frecht</i>, a Lutheran theological student, whom I had known in
Paris. One day I went to his house to ask him to take me to a
bookseller where he could serve me as interpreter. We called on the way
on a Jew who furnished me with money and who accompanied us.</p>
<p class="par">Being engaged in looking over a catalog at the book
store, a German officer entered the shop, and said to the bookseller
without any form of compliment, &ldquo;If among all the devils I could
find one to agree with you, I would still go and look for another
dealer.&rdquo; The bookseller replied that &ldquo;500 Rix dollars was
an excessive price, and that he ought to be satisfied with the 450 that
he offered.&rdquo; The officer told him to &ldquo;go <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name="pb29">29</a>]</span>to the
Devil,&rdquo; as he would do nothing of the sort, and was about to
leave. <i>Frecht</i>, who recognized him as a friend, stopped him and
having renewed his acquaintance, was curious to know what bargain he
had concluded with the bookseller. The officer carelessly drew from his
pocket a packet of parchment tied by a cord of yellow silk. &ldquo;I
wanted,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;500 Rix dollars to satisfy me for three
manuscripts which are in this package, but Mr. Bookseller does not wish
to give but 450.&rdquo; Frecht asked if he might see the curiosities.
The officer took them from his pocket, and the Jew and myself who had
been merely spectators now became interested, and approached Frecht,
who held the three books.</p>
<p class="par">The first which Frecht opened was an Italian imprint of
which the title was missing, and was supplied by another written by
hand which read</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<i lang="it">Specchia della Bestia
Triomphante.</i>&rdquo; The book did not appear of ancient date, and
had on the title neither year nor name of printer.</p>
<p class="par">We passed to the second, which was a manuscript without
title, the first page of which commenced &ldquo;OTHONI <i lang=
"it">illustrissimo amico meo charissimo</i>. <i>F. I. s. d.</i>&rdquo;
This embraced but two lines, after which followed a letter of which the
commencement was &ldquo;<i lang="la">Quod de tribus famosissimis
Nationum Deceptoribus in ordinem. Justu. meo digesti Doctissimus ille
vir, que cum Sermonem de illa re in Museo meo habuisti exscribi curavi
atque codicem illum stilo aeque, vero ac puro scriptum ad te ut primum
mitto, etenim ipsius per legendi te accipio
cupidissimum.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The other manuscript was also Latin, and without title
like the other. It commenced with these words&mdash;from <i>Cicero</i>
if I am not mistaken: &ldquo;<i lang="la">An. I. liber <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>de Nat.
Deor. Qui Deos esse dixerunt tantu sunt in Varietate et dissentione
constituti ut eorum molestum sit dinumerare sententias. Altidum freri
profecto potest ut eorum nulla, alterum certi non potest ut plus unum
vera fit. Summi quos in Republica obtinnerat honores orator ille
Romanus, ea que quam servare famam Studiote curabat, in causa fuere
quod in Concione Deos non ansus sit negare quamquam in contesta
Philosophorum, etc.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">We paid but little attention to the Italian production,
which only interested our Jew, who assured us that it was an invective
against Religion. We examined several phrases of the latter by which we
mutually agreed that it was a system of <i>Demonstrated Atheism</i>.
The second, which we have mentioned, attracted our entire attention,
and Frecht having persuaded his friend, whose name was
<i>Tausendorff</i>, not to take less than 500 Rix dollars, we left the
bookseller&rsquo;s shop, and Frecht, who had his own ideas, took us to
his inn, where he proposed to his friend to empty a bottle of good wine
together. Never did a German decline a like proposition, so Frecht
immediately ordered the wine, and asked Tausendorff to tell us how
these manuscripts fell into his possession.</p>
<p class="par">After enjoying his portion of <i>six</i> bottles of old
Moselle, he told us that after the victory at Hochstadt<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1388src" href="#xd21e1388" name="xd21e1388src">1</a>
and the flight of the Elector of Bavaria, he was one of those who
entered Munich, and in the palace of His Highness, he went from room to
room until he reached the library. Here his eyes fell by chance on the
package of parchments with the silk cord, and believing them to be
important papers or curiosities, he could not resist the temptation of
putting them in his pocket. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>He was not deceived when he opened
the package and convinced himself. This recital was accompanied by many
soldier-like digressions, as the wine had a little disarranged the
judgment of Tausendorff. Frecht, who, during the story, perused the
manuscript, took the chance of a refusal by asking his friend to allow
him to take the book until the next day. Tausendorff, whom the wine had
made generous, consented to the request of Frecht, but he exacted a
terrible oath that he would neither copy it or cause it to be done,
promising to come for it on Sunday and empty some more bottles of wine,
which he found to his taste.</p>
<p class="par">This obliging officer had no sooner left than we
commenced to decipher it. The writing was so small, full of
abbreviations, and without punctuation, that we were nearly two hours
in reading the first page, but as soon as we were accustomed to the
method we commenced to read it more easily. I found it so accurate and
written with so much care, that I proposed to Frecht an equivocal
method of making a copy without violating the oath which he had taken:
which method was to make a <i>translation</i>. The conscience of a
<i>theologian</i> did not but find difficulties in such proposal, but I
removed them as I could, assuming the sin myself, and in the end he
consented to work on the translation which was finished before the time
fixed by Tausendorff.</p>
<p class="par">This is the way in which this book came into our hands.
Many would have desired to possess the original but we were not rich
enough to buy it. The bookseller had a commission from a Prince of the
House of Saxony, who knew that it had been taken from the library at
Munich, and he was to spare no effort to secure it, if he found it, by
paying the 500 <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>Rix dollars to Tausendorff who went away several
days after, having regaled us in his turn.</p>
<p class="par">Passing to the origin of the book, and its author, one
can hardly give an account of either only by consulting the book itself
in which but little is found except for the base of conjecture. There
is only a letter at the beginning, and which is written in another
character from the rest of the book, which gives any light. We find it
addressed <i lang="it">OTHONI, Illustrissimo</i>. The place where the
manuscript was found, and the name OTHO put together warrants the
belief that it was addressed to the <i>Illustrious Otho, lord of
Bavaria</i>. This prince was grandson of <i>Otho, the Great; Count of
Schiren and Witelspach</i> from whom the House of Bavaria and the
Palatine had their origin. The Emperor <i>Frederick
Barbarossa</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e1418src" href="#xd21e1418"
name="xd21e1418src">2</a> had given him Bavaria for his fidelity, after
having taken it from <i>Henry the Lion</i> to punish him for his
inconsistency in taking the part of his enemies. <i>Louis I.</i>
succeeded his father, <i>Otho the Great</i>, and left Bavaria&mdash;in
the possession of which he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href=
"#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>had been disturbed by <i>Henry the
Lion</i>&mdash;to his son <i>Otho</i>, surnamed the <i>Illustrious</i>,
who assured his possession by wedding the daughter of Henry. This
happened about the year 1230, when <i>Frederick II.</i>, Emperor of
Germany, returned from Jerusalem, where, at the solicitation of <i>Pope
Gregory IX.</i>, he had pursued the war against the Saracens, and from
whence he returned irritated to excess against the Holy Father who had
incensed his army against him, as well as the <i>Templars</i> and the
<i>Patriarch</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i>, until the Emperor refused to obey
the Pope.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Otho the Illustrious</i> recognizing the obligations
that his family were under to the family of the Emperor, took his part
and remained firmly attached to him, notwithstanding all the
vicissitudes of fortune of Frederick.</p>
<p class="par">Why these historical reminiscences? To sustain the
conjecture that it was to this <i>Otho the Illustrious</i> that this
copy of the pamphlet of the <i>Three Impostors</i> was addressed. By
whom? This is why we are led to believe that the F. I. s. d<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e1589" title="Not in source">.</span> which follows
<i lang="la">L&rsquo;amico meo carissimo</i>, and which we interpret
FREDERICUS. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span><i lang="la">Imperator salutem Domino</i>. Thus
this would be by The <i>Emperor Frederick II.</i>, son of <i>Henry
IV.</i> and grandson of <i>Frederick Barbarossa</i>, who, succeeding to
their Empire, had at the same time inherited the hatred of the Roman
Pontiffs.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1609src" href="#xd21e1609" name=
"xd21e1609src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">Those who have read the history of the Church and that
of the Empire, will recall with what pride and arrogance the indolent
<i>Alexander III.</i> placed his foot on the neck of <i>Frederick
Barbarossa</i>, who came to him to sue for peace. Who does not know the
evil that the Holy See did to his son <i>Henry VI.</i>, against whom
his own wife took up arms at the persuasion of the Pope? At last
<i>Frederick II.</i> uniting in himself all the resolution which was
wanting in his father and grandfather, saw the purpose of <i>Gregory
IX.</i>, who seemed to have marshalled on his side all the hatred of
<i>Alexander</i>, <i>Innocent</i> and <i>Honorius</i> against his
<i>Imperial Majesty</i>. One brought the steel of persecution, and the
other the lightning of excommunication, and furiously they vied with
each other in circulating infamous libels. This, it seems to me, is
warrant sufficient to apply these happenings to the belief that this
book was by order of the Emperor, who was incensed against religion by
the vices of its Chief, and written by the <i lang="la">Doctissimus
vir</i>, who is mentioned in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>letter as having composed this
treatise, and which consequently owes its existence not so much to a
search for truth, as to a spirit of hatred and implacable
animosity.</p>
<p class="par">This conjecture may be further confirmed by remarking
that this book was never mentioned only since the <i lang=
"fr">r&eacute;gime</i> of that Emperor, and even during his reign it
was attributed him, since <i lang="fr">Pierre des Vignes</i>, his
secretary, endeavored to cast this false impression on the enemies of
his master, saying that they circulated it to render him odious.</p>
<p class="par">Now to determine the <i lang="la">Doctissimus vir</i>
who is the author of the book in question. First, it is certain that
the epoch of the book was that which we have endeavored to prove.
Second, that it was encouraged by those accused of its authorship,
possibly excepting <i><span class="corr" id="xd21e1678" title=
"Source: Avervoes">Averroes</span></i>, who died before the birth of
<i>Frederick II.</i> All the others lived a long time, even entire
centuries after the composition of this work. I admit that it is
difficult to determine the author only by marking the period when the
book first made its appearance, and in whatever direction I turn, I
find no one to whom it could more probably be attributed than <i lang=
"fr">Pierre des Vignes</i> whom I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="par">If we had not his tract &ldquo;<i lang="la">De poteste
Imperiali</i>,&rdquo; his other epistles suffice to show with what zeal
he entered into the resentment of <i>Frederick II.</i> (whose Secretary
he was) against the Holy See. Those who have spoken of him,
<i>Ligonius</i>, <i>Trithemus</i> and <i>Rainaldi</i>, furnish such an
accurate description of him, his condition and his spirit, that after
considering this I cannot remark but that this evidence favors my
conjecture. Again, as I have remarked, he himself spoke of this book in
his epistles, and he endeavored to accuse the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>enemies
of his master to lessen the clamor made to encourage the belief that
this Prince was the author. As he had taken the greater part, he did
not greatly exert himself to lessen the injurious noise, so that if the
accusation was strengthened by passing for a long time from mouth to
mouth it would not fall from the Master on his Secretary, who was
probably more capable of the production than a great Emperor, always
occupied with the clamors of war and always in fear of the thunders of
the Vatican. In one word, the Emperor, however valiant and resolute,
had no time to become a scholar like <i>Pierre des Vignes</i>, who had
given all the necessary attention to his studies, and who owed his
position and the affection of his Master entirely to his learning.</p>
<p class="par">I believe that we can conclude from all this, that this
little book <i lang="la">Tribus famosissimus Nationum Deceptoribus</i>,
for that is its true title, was composed after the year 1230 by command
of the Emperor <i>Frederick II.</i> in hatred of the Court of Rome: and
it is quite apparent that <i>Pierre des Vignes</i>, Secretary to the
Emperor, was the author.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1721src" href=
"#xd21e1721" name="xd21e1721src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">This is all that I deem proper for a preface to this
little treatise, and as it contains many naughty allusions, to prevent
that in the future, it may not be again attributed to those who perhaps
never entertained such ideas.</p>

<p class="par">I have taken the trouble to have copied the Treatise
which was made concerning the <i>Three Famous Impostors</i>, by the
learned man by whom you were entertained on this subject, in my study,
and though you have not requested it, I send you the manuscript entire,
in which the purity of style equals the truth of the matter, for I know
with what interest you desired to read it, and also I am persuaded that
nothing could please you more.</p>
<p class="par">It is not the first time that I have overcome my cruel
enemies, and placed my foot on the neck of the Roman Hydra whose skin
is not more red than the blood of the millions of men that its fury has
sacrificed to its abominable arrogance.</p>
<p class="par">Be assured that I will neglect nothing to have you
understand that I will either triumph or perish in the attempt; for
whatever reverses may happen to me, I will not, like my predecessors,
bend my knee before them.</p>
<p class="par">I hope that my sword, and the fidelity of the members of
the Empire; your advice and your assistance will contribute not a
little. But nothing would add more if all Germany could be inspired
with the sentiments of the Doctor&mdash;the author of this book. This
is much to be desired, but where are those capable of accomplishing
such a project? I recommend to you our common interests, live happy. I
shall always be your friend.</p>

<p class="par first">However important it may be for all men to know
the Truth, very few, nevertheless, are acquainted with it, because the
majority are incapable of searching it themselves, or perhaps, do not
wish the trouble. Thus we must not be astonished if the world is filled
with vain and ridiculous opinions, and nothing is more capable of
making them current than ignorance, which is the sole source of the
false ideas that exist regarding the Divinity, the soul, and the
spirit, and all the errors depending thereon.</p>
<p class="par">The custom of being satisfied with born prejudice has
prevailed, and by following this custom, mankind agrees in all things
with persons interested in supporting stubbornly the opinions thus
received, and who would speak otherwise did they not fear to destroy
themselves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=

after having established these silly ideas of God, they teach the
people to receive them without examination. They take great care to
impress them with aversion for philosophers, fearing that the Truth
which they teach will alienate them. The errors in which the partisans
of these absurdities have been plunged, have thrived so well that it is
dangerous to combat them. It is too important for these impostors that
the people remain in this gross and culpable ignorance than to allow
them to be disabused. Thus they are constrained to disguise the truth,
or to be sacrificed to the rage of false prophets and selfish

<p class="par first">If the people could comprehend the abyss in which
this ignorance casts them, they would doubtless throw off the yoke of
these venal minds, since it is impossible for Reason to act without
immediately discovering the Truth. It is to prevent the good effects
that would certainly follow, that they depict it as a monster incapable
of inspiring any good sentiment, and however we may censure in general
those who are not reasonable, we must nevertheless be persuaded that
Truth is quite perverted. These enemies of Truth fall also into such
perpetual contradictions that it is difficult to perceive what their
real pretensions are. In the meanwhile it is true that Common Sense is
the only rule that men should follow, and the world should not be
prevented from making use of it.</p>
<p class="par">We may try to persuade, but those who are appointed to
instruct, should endeavor to rectify false reasoning and efface
prejudices, then will the people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40"

they become susceptible of Truth, and learn that God is not all that
they imagine.</p>

<p class="par first">To accomplish this, wild speculation is not
necessary, neither is it required to deeply penetrate the secrets of
Nature. Only a little good sense is needed to see that God is neither
passionate nor jealous, that justice and mercy are false titles
attributed to him, and that nothing of what the Prophets and Apostles
have said constitutes his nature nor his essence. In effect, to speak
without disguise and to state the case properly, it is certain that
these doctors were neither more clever or better informed than the rest
of mankind, but far from that, what they say is so gross that it must
be the people only who would believe them.</p>
<p class="par">The matter is self-evident, but to make it more clear,
let us see if they are differently constituted than other men.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As to their birth and the ordinary functions of
life, it is agreed that they possessed nothing above the human; that
they were born of man and woman and lived the same as ourselves. But
for mind, it must be that God favored them more than other men, for
they claimed an understanding more brilliant than others. We must admit
that mankind has a leaning toward blindness, because it is said that
God loved the prophets more than the rest of mankind, that he
frequently communicated with them, and he believed them also of good
faith. Now if this condition was sensible, and without considering that
all men resembled each other, and that they each had a principle
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>equal in all, it was pretended that these prophets
were of extraordinary attainments and were created expressly to utter
the oracles of God. But further, if they had more wit than common, and
more perfect understanding, what do we find in their writings to oblige
us to have this opinion of them?</p>
<p class="par">The greater part of their writings is so obscure that it
is not understood, and put together in such a poor manner that we can
hardly believe that they comprehended it themselves, and that they must
have been very ignorant impostors. That which causes this belief of
them is that they boasted of receiving directly from God all that they
announced to the people&mdash;an absurd and ridiculous belief&mdash;and
avowing that God only spoke to them in dreams. Dreams are quite
natural, and a person must be quite vain or senseless to boast that God
speaks to him at such a time, and when faith is added, he must be quite
credulous since there is no evidence that dreams are oracles. Suppose
even that God manifested himself by dreams, by visions, or in any other
way, are we obliged to believe a man who may deceive himself, and which
is worse, who is inclined to <i>lie</i>?</p>
<p class="par">Now we see that under the ancient law they had for
prophets none more esteemed than at the present day. Then when the
people were tired of their sophistry, which often tended to turn them
from obedience to their legitimate Ruler, they restrained them by
various punishments, just as Jesus was overwhelmed because he had not,
like Moses,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1823src" href="#xd21e1823" name=
"xd21e1823src">2</a> an army at his back to sustain his opinions. Added
to that, the Prophets were so in the habit of contradicting each other
that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>among four hundred not one reliable one was to be
found.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1828src" href="#xd21e1828" name=
"xd21e1828src">3</a></p>
<p class="par">It is even certain that the aim of their prophecies, as
well as the laws of the celebrated legislators were to perpetuate their
memories by causing mankind to believe that they had private conference
with God. Most political objects have been projected in such manner.
However, such tricks have not always been successful for those,
who&mdash;with the exception of <i>Moses</i>&mdash;had not the means of
providing for their safety.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">VI.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This being determined, let us examine the ideas
which the Prophets had of God, and we will smile at their grossness and
contradictions. To believe them, God is a purely corporeal being.
<i>Micah</i> sees him seated. <i>Daniel</i> clothed in white and in the
form of an old man, and <i>Ezekiel</i> like a fire. So much for the Old
Testament, now for the New. The disciples of J. C. imagined the Holy
Spirit in the figure of a dove; the apostles, in the form of tongues of
fire, and <i>St. Paul</i>, as a light which dazzled the sight unto
blindness.</p>
<p class="par">To show their contradictory opinions, <i>Samuel</i>,
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1sam%2015:29">I. ch.
15, v. 29</a>), believed that God never repented of his own resolution.
Again, <i>Jeremiah</i>, (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=jer%2018:10">ch. 18, v.
10</a>), says that God repented of a resolve he had taken. <i>Joel</i>,
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=joel%202:13">ch. 2,
v. 13</a>), says that he only repents of the evil he has done to
mankind. <i>Genesis</i><span class="corr" id="xd21e1879" title=
"Not in source">,</span> (<a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=gen%204:7">ch. 4, v.
7</a>), informs us that man is prone to evil, but that He has nothing
for him but blessings. On the contrary, <i>St. Paul</i>, (<a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rom%209:10">Romans, ch.
9, v. 10</a>), says that men have no <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>command of concupiscence
except by the grace and particular calling of God. These are the noble
sentiments that these good people have of God, and what they would have
us believe. Sentiments, however, entirely sensible, and quite material
as we see, and yet they say that God has nothing in common with matter,
is a sensible and material being, and that he is something
incomprehensible to our understanding. I should like to be informed how
these contradictions may be harmonized, and how, under such visible and
palpable conditions it is proper to believe them. Again, how can we
accept the testimony of a people so clownish that they, notwithstanding
all the artifices of Moses, should imagine a <i>calf</i> to be their
God! But not considering the dreams of a race raised in servitude, and
among the superstitious, we can agree that ignorance has produced
credulity, and credulity falsehood, from whence arises all the errors
which exist today.</p>

invoke in adversity, whom they praise in prosperity, and of whom in the
end they make Gods. And as the visions of men go to extremes, must we
be astonished if there are created an innumerable quantity of
<i>Divinities</i>? It is the same perceptible fear of invisible powers
which has been the origin of Religions, that each forms to his fashion.
Many individuals to whom it was important that mankind should possess

<p class="par first">It should be agreed that all men are born in
profound ignorance, and that the only thing natural to them is a desire
to discover what may be useful and proper, and evade what may be
inexpedient to them. Thence it follows <i>first</i>, that we believe
that to be free it suffices to feel personally that one can wish and
desire without being annoyed by the causes which dispose us to wish and
desire, because we do not know them. <i>Second</i>, it consequently
occurs that men are contented to do nothing but for one object, that is
to say, for that object which is preferable above all, and that is why
they have a desire only to know the final result of their action,
imagining that after discovering this they have no reason to doubt
anything. Now as they find in and about themselves many means of
procuring what they desire: having, for example, ears to hear, eyes to
see, animals to nourish, a sun to give light, they have formed this
reasoning, <i>that there is nothing in nature which was not made for
them, and of which they may dispose and enjoy</i>. Then reflecting that
they did not make this world, they believe it to be a well-founded
proposition to imagine a Supreme Being who has made it for them such as
it is, for after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>satisfying themselves that <i>they</i> could not
have made it, they conclude that it was the work of one or several Gods
who intended it for the use and pleasure of man alone. On the other
hand, the nature of the Gods whom man has admitted, being unknown, they
have concluded in their own minds that these Gods susceptible of the
same passions as men, have made the earth only for them, and that man
to them was extremely precious. But as each one has different
inclinations it became proper to adore God according to the humor of
each, to attract his blessings and to cause Him to make all Nature
subject to his desires.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">By this method this precedent becomes
Superstition, and it is implanted so that the grossest natures are
believed capable of penetrating the doctrine of final causes as if they
had perfect knowledge. Thus in place of showing that <i>nature has made
nothing in vain</i>, they show that God and Nature dream as well as
men, and that they may not be accused of doubting things, let us see
how they have put forth their false reasoning on this subject.</p>
<p class="par">Experience causing them to see a myriad of
inconveniences marring the pleasure of life, such as storms,
earthquakes, sickness, famine and thirst, they draw the conclusion that
nature has not been made for them alone. They attribute all these evils
to the wrath of the Gods, who are vexed by the offences of man, and
they cannot be disabused of these ideas by the daily instances which
should prove to them that blessings and evils have been always common
to the wicked and the good, and they will not agree to a proposition so
plain and perceptible. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The reason for that is, it is more easy to remain in

introduce something more probable.</p>

belief that the judgments of God were incomprehensible, and that for
this reason, the knowledge of truth is beyond the human mind; and
mankind would still dwell in error were it not that mathematics and
several other sciences had destroyed these prejudices.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">By this it may be seen that Nature or God does not
propose any end, and that all final causes are but human fictions. A
long lecture is not necessary since this doctrine takes away from God
the perfection ascribed to him, and this is how it may be proved. If
God acted for a result, either for himself or another, he desires what
he has not, and we must allow that there are times when God has not the
wherewith to act; he has merely desired it and that only creates an
impotent God. To omit nothing that may be applied to this reasoning,
let us oppose it with those of a contrary nature. If, for example, a
stone falls on a person and kills him, it is well known they say, that
the stone fell with the design of killing the man, and that could only
happen by the will of God. If you reply that the wind caused the stone
to drop at the moment the man passed, they will ask why the man should
have passed precisely at the time when the wind moved the stone. If you
say that the wind was so severe that the sea was also troubled since
the day before while there appeared to be no agitation in the air, and
the man having been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span>invited to dine with a friend, went to keep
his appointment. Again they ask, for the man never got there, why he
should be the guest of his friend at this time more than another,
adding questions after questions, finally avowing that it was but the
will of God, (which is a true &ldquo;<i>asses bridge</i>&rdquo;) and
the cause of this misfortune.</p>
<p class="par">Again when they note the symmetry of the human body,
they stand in admiration and conclude how ignorant they are of the
causes of a thing which to them appears so marvelous, that it is a
supernatural work, in which the causes known to us could have no
part.</p>
<p class="par">Thence it comes that those who desire to know the real
cause of supposed miracles and penetrate like true scholars into their
natural causes without amusing themselves with the prejudice of the
ignorant, it happens that the true scholar passes for impious and
heretical by the malice of those whom the vulgar recognize as the
expounders of <i>Nature</i> and of <i>God</i>. These mercenary
individuals do not question the ignorance which holds the people in
astonishment, upon whom they subsist and who preserve their credit.</p>

<p class="par first">Mankind being thus of the ridiculous opinion that
all they see is made for themselves, have made it a religious duty to
apply it to their interest, and of judging the price of things by the
profit they gain. Thence proceed the ideas they have formed of
<i>good</i>, and <i>evil</i>, of <i>order</i> and <i>confusion</i>, of
<i>heat</i> and <i>cold</i>, of <i>beauty</i> and <i>ugliness</i>,
which serve to explain to them the nature of things, which in the end
are not what they imagine. Because they pride themselves in having free
will they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=

<i>praise</i> and <i>blame</i>, <i>sin</i> and <i>merit</i>, calling
everything good which redounds to their profit and which concerns
<i>divine worship</i>, and to the contrary denominate as evil that
which agrees with neither. Because the ignorant are not capable of
judging what may be a little abstruse, and having no idea of things
only by the aid of <i>imagination</i> which they consider
<i>understanding</i>, these folk who know not what represents
<i>Order</i> in the world believe all that they imagine. Man being
inclined in such a manner that they think things well or ill ordered as
they have the facility or trouble to conclude when good sense would
teach differently. Some are more pleased to be weary of the means of
investigation, being satisfied to remain as they are, preferring order
to confusion, as if order was another thing than a pure effect of the
imagination of man, so that when it is said that <i>God has made
everything in order</i>, it is recognizing that he has that faculty of
imagination as well as man. If it was not so, perhaps to favor human
imagination they pretend that God created this world in the easiest
manner imaginable, although there are an hundred things far above the
force of imagination, and an infinity which may be thrown into disorder
by reason of weakness.</p>

same imagination, which have nothing real, and which are but the
different modes of which this power is capable. For example, if the

bitter, that which we touch hard or soft, sounds, harsh or agreeable.
According as odors, tastes or sounds strike and penetrate the senses,
just so we find a belief that God is capable of taking pleasure in
melody, that the celestial movements are a harmonious concert, proof
evident that each one believes that things are such as they are
imagined, or that the world is purely imaginary. That is why we should
not be surprised if we rarely found two men of the same opinion, and
some who glorify themselves in doubting everything. For while men have
bodies which resemble each other in many particulars, they differ in
some others, and it should not astonish us that what seems good to one
appears bad to another: what pleases this one displeases the other,
from which we may infer that opinions only differ by fancy, that
understanding passes for little, and to conclude, things which happen
every day are purely the effects of imagination. If one should consult
the lights of understanding of philosophers he would have faith that
everybody would agree to the truth, and that judgments would be more
uniform and reasonable than they are.</p>

<p class="par first">It is then evident that all the reasons of which
men are accustomed to avail themselves when they endeavor to explain
Nature, are only methods of imagination which prove nothing less than
they pretend, and because they have given to these reasons names so
real that if they existed otherwise than in imagination I would not
call them <i>reasonable beings</i>, but purely chimerical, seeing
nothing more easy than to respond to arguments founded on these vulgar
notions and which we oppose as follows. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">If it was true that the universe was a chance happening,
and a necessary sequel of divine nature, whence come the imperfections
and faults which we remark? For example, corruption which fills the air
with bad odor, many disagreeable objects, so many disorders, so much
evil, so many crimes and other like occurrences. Nothing is more easy
than to refute these objections, for one cannot judge of the perfection
of ancient existence only by knowing its essence and nature, and we
deceive ourselves in thinking that a thing is more or less perfect, as
it pleases or displeases, is useful or useless to human nature; and to
close the mouths of those who ask why God has not created all men
without exception that they might be guided by the light of reason, it
is enough to say that it was because the material was not sufficient to
give each being the degree of perfection that was most suitable for
him, or to speak more proper, because the laws of nature were so ample
and extensive that they could suffice for the production of all things
of which an infinite understanding is capable.</p>

<p class="par first">Until now we have fought the popular idea
concerning the Divinity, but we have not yet said what God is, and if
we were asked, we should say that the word represents to us an Infinite
Being, of whom one of his attributes is to be a substance of extent and
consequently eternal and infinite. The extent or the quantity not being
finite or divisible, it may be imagined that the matter was everywhere
the same, our understanding not distinguishing parts. For example,
water, as much as water is imagined, is divisible, and its parts
separable from one another, though as much as a <i>corporeal
substance</i> it is neither separable nor divisible.<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e2122src" href="#xd21e2122" name="xd21e2122src">1</a> Thus
neither matter or quantity have anything unworthy of God, for if all is
God, and all comes surely from his essence, it follows quite absolutely
that He is all that he contains, since it is incomprehensible that
Beings quite material should be contained in a Being who is not. That
we may not think that this is a new opinion, <i>Tertullian</i>, one of
the foremost men among the Christians, has pronounced against
<i>Apelles</i>, that, &ldquo;that which is not matter is
nothing,&rdquo; and against <i>Praxias</i>, that &ldquo;all substance
is matter,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"

<p class="par first">These sentiments are plain and the only ones that
good and sound judgment can form of God. However, there are but few who
are satisfied with such simplicity. Boorish people, who are accustomed
to adulation of opinion, demand a God who resembles earthly kings. The
pomp and circumstance surrounding them so fascinates, that to take away
all hope of going after death to increase the number of heavenly
courtiers enjoying the same pleasure which attaches to the Court of
Kings, is to take away the consolation and the only things which
prevent them from going to despair over the miseries of life. They want
a <i>just</i> and <i>avenging</i> God, who <i>rewards</i> and
<i>punishes</i> after the manner of kings, a God susceptible of all
human passions and weaknesses. They give him feet, hands, and ears, and
yet they do not regard a God so constituted as material. They say that
man is his masterpiece, and even his own image, but do not allow that
the copy is like the original. In a word, the God of the people of
today is subject to as many forms as Jupiter of the Pagans, and what is
still more strange, these follies contradict each other and shock good
sense. The vulgar reverence them because they firmly believe what the
Prophets have said, although these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54"

were the same as the augurs and the diviners among the pagans.<a class=

They consult the Bible as if God or nature was therein expounded to
them in a special manner, however this book is only a rhapsody of
fragments, gathered at various times, selected by several persons, and
given to the people according to the fancy of the Rabbins, who did not
publish them until after approving some, and rejecting others, and
seeing if they were conformable or opposed to the Law of
Moses.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2166src" href="#xd21e2166" name=

they prefer to pass their lives disputing with one another, and
worshipping a book received from ignorant people; a book with little
order or method, which everyone admits as confused and badly conceived,
only serving to foment divisions.</p>
<p class="par">Christians would rather adore this phantom than listen
to the law of Nature which God&mdash;that is to say, Nature, which is
the active principle&mdash;has written in the heart of man. All other
laws are but human fictions, and pure illusions forged, not by Demons
or evil spirits, which are fanciful ideas, but by the skill of Princes
and Ecclesiastics to give the former more warrant for their authority,
and to enrich the latter by the traffic in an infinity of chimeras
which sell to the ignorant at a good price.</p>
<p class="par">All other laws are not supported save on the authority
of the Bible, in the original of which appear <span class=

and which speaks only of recompenses or punishments for good or bad
actions, but which are wisely deferred for a future life, relying that
the trick will not be discovered in this, no one having returned from
the other to tell the news. Thus, men kept ever wavering between hope
and fear, are held to their duty by the belief they aver that God has
created man only to render him eternally happy or unhappy, and which
has given rise to the infinity of religions which we are about to
discuss.</p>

<p class="par first">Before the word Religion was introduced in the
world mankind was only obliged to follow natural laws and to conform to
common sense. This instinct alone was the tie by which men were united,
and so very simple was this bond of unity, that nothing among them was
more rare than dissensions. But when fear created a suspicion that
there were Gods, and invisible powers, they raised altars to these
imaginary beings, so that in putting off the yoke of Nature and Reason,
which are the sources of true life, they subjected themselves by vain
ceremonies and superstitious worship to frivolous phantoms of the
imagination, and that is whence arose this word Religion which makes so
much noise in the world.</p>
<p class="par">Men having admitted invisible forces which were
all-powerful over them, they worshipped them to appease them, and
further imagined that Nature was a being subordinate to this power,
thence they had the idea that it was a great mace that threatened, or a
slave that acted only by the order that such power gave him. Since this
false idea had broken their will they had only scorn for Nature, and
respect only for those pretended beings that they called their Gods.
Thence came the ignorance in which mankind was plunged, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>and from
which the well-informed, however deep the abyss, could have rescued
them, if their zeal had not been extinguished by those who led them
blindly, and who lived by imposture. But though there was but little
appearance of success in the enterprise, it was not necessary to
abandon the party of truth, and only in consideration of those who were
afflicted with the symptoms of so great an evil, were generous souls
available to represent matters as they were.</p>

were the cause of their good and bad fortune, they lost their good
sense and reason substituting for their chimeras so many
<i>Divinities</i> who had care of their conduct.</p>
<p class="par">After having forged these Gods they were curious to know
of what matter they consisted, and finally imagined that they should be
of the same substance as the soul. Then being persuaded that the latter
resembled the shadows which appear in a mirror, or during sleep, they
believed that some Gods were real substances but so thin and subtile
that to distinguish them from bodies they called them <i>Spirits</i>.
So that bodies and spirits were in effect the same thing, and differed
neither more nor less, and to be <i>both</i> corporeal and incorporeal
is a most incomprehensible thing. The reason given is that each spirit
has a proper form, and is included within some limit, that is to say
that it has some boundaries, and consequently must be a body however
thin and subtile it might be.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2216src" href=

future by the past, while seeing neither cohesion nor dependence.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The celebrated <i>Moses</i>, grandson of a great
magician,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2530src" href="#xd21e2530" name=
"xd21e2530src">1</a> by the account of <i>Justin Martyr</i>, had all
the advantages proper for what he afterwards became. It is well known
that the Hebrews, of whom he became the Chief, were a nation of
shepherds whom King Pharaoh Orus I. received in his country in
consideration of services that he had received from one of them in the
time of a great famine. He gave them some lands in the east of Egypt in
a country fertile in pasturage, and consequently adapted for their
flocks.</p>
<p class="par">During 200 years they rapidly increased, because, being
considered foreigners they were not required to serve in the armies of
Pharaoh, and because of the natural advantages of the lands which
<i>Orus</i> had granted them. Some bands of Arabs came to join them as
brothers, for they were of a similar race, and they increased so
astonishingly that the land of Goshen not being able to contain them
they spread all over Egypt, giving Pharaoh Memnon II. good reason to
fear that they might be capable of some dangerous attempt in case Egypt
was attacked (as happened soon after) by their active enemies, the
Ethiopians. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Thus a policy of state compelled this Prince to curtail
their privileges, and to seek means to weaken and enslave them. Pharaoh
Orus II. surnamed <i>Busiris</i> because of his cruelty, and who
succeeded <i>Memnon</i>, followed his plan regarding the Jews. Wishing
to perpetuate his memory by the erection of the Pyramids and building
the city of Thebes, he condemned the Hebrews to labor at making bricks,
the material in the earth of their country being adapted for this
purpose. During this servitude the celebrated <i>Moses</i> was born, in
the same year that the King issued an edict to cast all the male Hebrew
children into the Nile, seeing that he had no surer means of
exterminating this rabble of foreigners.</p>
<p class="par">Moses was exposed to perish in the waters in a basket
covered with pitch, which his mother placed in the rushes on the banks
of the river. It chanced that <i>Thermitis</i>, daughter of
<i>Orus</i>, was walking near the shore and hearing the cries of the
child, the natural compassion of her sex inspired her to save it.</p>
<p class="par">Orus having died, Thermitis succeeded him, and Moses
having been presented to her, she caused him to be educated in a manner
befitting the son of a Queen of the wisest and most polished nation of
the universe. In a word he was <i>tutored in all the science of the
Egyptians</i>, and it is admitted, and they have represented Moses to
us as the greatest politician, the wisest philosopher and the most
famous <i>magician</i> of his time. It followed that he was admitted to
the order of Priesthood, which was in Egypt what the <i>Druids</i> were
in Gaul, that is to say&mdash;<i>everything</i>.</p>
<p class="par">Those who are not familiar with what the government of
Egypt was, will be pleased to know that the famous dynasties having
come to an end, the entire <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>country was dependent upon one
Sovereign who divided it into several provinces of no great extent. The
governors of these countries were called <i>monarchs</i>, and they were
ordinarily of the powerful order of Priests, who possessed nearly
one-third of Egypt. The king named these <i>monarchs</i>, and if we can
believe the authors who have written of Moses and compare what they
have said with what Moses himself has written, we may conclude that he
was <i>monarch</i> of the land of <i>Goshen</i>, and that he owed his
elevation to Thermitis, who had also saved his life.</p>
<p class="par">We see what Moses was in Egypt, where he had both time
and means to study the manners of the Egyptians, and those of his
nation: their governing passions, their inclinations, and all that
would be of service to him in his effort to excite the revolution of
which he was the promoter.</p>
<p class="par">Thermitis having died, her successor renewed the
persecution against the Hebrews, and <i>Moses</i> having lost his
previous favor, and fearing that he could not justify several homicides
that he had committed, took the precaution to flee.</p>
<p class="par">He retired to <i>Arabia Petrea</i>, on the confines of
Egypt, and chance brought him to the home of a tribal chief of the
country. His services, and the talents that his master remarked in him,
merited his good graces and one of his daughters in marriage. It is
here to be noted that Moses was such a bad Jew, and knew so little of
the <i>redoubtable God</i> whom he invented later, that he wedded an
idolatress, and did not even think of having his children
circumcised.</p>
<p class="par">It was in the Arabian deserts, while guarding the flocks
of his father-in-law and brother-in-law, he conceived the design of
avenging the injustice which had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66"
href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>been done him by the King of
Egypt, by bringing trouble and sedition in the court of his states; and
he flattered himself that he could easily succeed in this by reason of
his talents, as by the disposition which he knew he would find in his
nation already incensed against the government by reason of the bad
treatment that they had been caused to suffer.</p>
<p class="par">It appears by the history which he has told of this
revolution, or at least by the author of the books attributed to Moses,
that <i>Jethro</i>, his brother-in-law, was in the conspiracy, as well
as his brother <i>Aaron</i> and his sister <i>Mary</i>, who had
remained in Egypt, and with whom he could arrange to hold
correspondence. As may be seen by the sequel he had formed a vast plan
in good politics, and he could put in service against <i>Egypt</i> all
the science he had learned there, and the pretended <i>Magic</i> in
which he was more subtle and skillful than all those at the Court of
Pharaoh who possessed the same accomplishments. It was by these
pretended miracles that he gained the confidence of those of his nation
that he caused to rebel. He joined to them thousands of mutinous
Egyptians, Ethiopians and Arabs. Boasting the power of his
<i>Divinity</i> and the frequent interviews he held with Him, and
causing Him to intervene in all the measures he took with the chiefs of
the revolt, he persuaded them so well that they followed him to the
number of 600,000 combatants&mdash;besides the women and
children&mdash;across the deserts of Arabia, of which he knew all the
windings.</p>
<p class="par">After a <i>six</i> days march on a laborious retreat, he
commanded his followers to consecrate the <i>seventh</i> to his God by
a <i>public rest</i>, to make them believe that this God favored him,
that he approved his sway, and that no one could have the audacity to
contradict him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">There were never any people more ignorant than the
Hebrews, and consequently none more credulous. To be convinced of this
profound ignorance, it is only necessary to recall the condition of
these people in Egypt when <i>Moses</i> made them revolt. They were
hated by the Egyptians because of their pastoral life, persecuted by
the Sovereign and employed in the vilest labor.</p>
<p class="par">Among such a populace it was not very difficult for
Moses to avail himself of his talents. He made them believe that his
God (whom he sometimes simply called an <i>angel</i>)&mdash;the <i>God
of their Fathers</i>&mdash;appeared to him, that it was by his order
that he took care to lead them, that he had chosen him for Governor,
and that they would be the favored people of this God, provided they
believed what he said on his part.</p>
<p class="par">He added to his exhortations on the part of his God, the
adroit use of his prestige, and the knowledge that he had of nature. He
confirmed what he said to them by what might be called <i>miracles</i>,
always easy to perform, and which made a great impression on an
imbecile populace.</p>
<p class="par">It may be remarked above all, that he believed he had
found a sure method for holding this people submissive to his orders,
in making accessory of the statement that God himself was their leader:
by night a <i>column of fire</i> and a <i>cloud</i> by day. But it can
be proved that this was the grossest trick of this impostor, and that
it might serve him for a long time. He had learned during his travels
that he had made in Arabia, a country vast and uninhabited, that it was
the custom of those who traveled in companies to take guides who
conducted them in the night by means of a brazier, the flame of which
they followed, and in the day time by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>the smoke of the same
brazier which all the members of the caravan could see, and
consequently not go astray. This custom prevailed among the
<i>Medes</i> and <i>Assyrians</i>, and it is quite natural that Moses
used it, and made it pass for a <i>miracle</i>, and a mark of the
protection of his God. If I may not be believed when I say that this
was a trick, let Moses himself be believed, who in <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=num%2010:29-33">Numbers,
Chap. x. v. 29&ndash;33</a>, asks his brother-in-law, Hobab, to come
with the Israelites, <i>that he may show them the roads, because he
knew the country</i>. This is demonstrative, for if it was God who
marched before Israel night and day in the <i>cloud</i> and the
<i>column of fire</i> could they have a better guide? Meanwhile here is
Moses exhorting his brother-in-law by the most pressing motives of
interest to serve him as <i>Guide</i>. Then the <i>cloud</i> and the
<i>column of fire</i> was God only for the people, and not for Moses,
who knew what it was.</p>
<p class="par">These poor unfortunates thus seduced, charmed at being
adopted by the Master of God, as they were told, emerging from a hard
and cruel bondage, applauded Moses and swore to obey him. His authority
was thus confirmed. He sought to perpetuate it, and under pretext of
establishing divine worship, or of a supreme God of whom he said he was
the lieutenant, he made his brother and his children chiefs of the
Royal Palace, that is to say, of the place where miracles were
performed out of the sight and presence of the people.</p>
<p class="par">So he continued these pretended miracles, at which the
simple were amazed and others stupefied, but which caused those who
were wise and who saw through these impostures to pity them. However
skillful Moses was, and how many clever tricks he knew how to do,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>he would have had much trouble to secure obedience
if he had not a strong army.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2710src" href=
"#xd21e2710" name="xd21e2710src">2</a> Deceit without force has rarely
succeeded.</p>
<p class="par">It was in order to have assured means to maintain
obedience against the discerning that he continued to place in his own
faction those of his tribe, giving them all the important charges and
exempting them from the greater part of the labors. He knew how to
create jealousies among the other tribes, some of whom took his part
against the others. Finally assuring adroitly to his interest those who
appeared the most enlightened, by placing them in his confidence, he
secured them by giving them employment of distinction.</p>
<p class="par">After that he found some of these idiots had the courage
to reproach his bad faith; that under his false pretense of justice and
equity he was seizing everything. As the sovereign authority was vested
in his blood in such manner that no one had a right to aspire to it,
they considered finally that he was less their father than their
tyrant.</p>
<p class="par">On such occasions Moses by cunning policy confounded
these <i>free-thinkers</i> and spared none who censured his
government.</p>
<p class="par">With such precautions, and cloaking his punishments
under the name of <i>Divine</i> vengeance, he continued absolute, and
to finish in the same way he began, that is to say by deceit and
imposture, he chose an extraordinary death. He cast himself in an abyss
in a lonely place where he retired from time to time under pretext of
conferring with God, and which he had long <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>designed
for his tomb. His body never having been found, it was believed that
his God had taken him, and that he had become like Him.</p>
<p class="par">He knew that the memories of the patriarchs who preceded
him were held in great veneration when their sepulchres were found, but
that was not sufficient for an ambition like his. He must be revered as
a God for whom death had no terrors, and to this end all his efforts
were directed since the beginning of his reign when he said that he was
established of God&mdash;to be the <i>God of Pharaoh</i>.
Elijah<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2735src" href="#xd21e2735" name=

their names, have concealed the time and place of their death so that
they would be deemed immortal.</p>

<p class="par first"><i>Jesus Christ</i>, who was not unacquainted with
the maxims and science of the Egyptians, among whom he dwelt several
years, availed himself of this knowledge, deeming it proper for the
design which he meditated. Considering that Moses was renowned because
he commanded an ignorant people, he undertook to build on a similar
foundation, and his followers were only some idiots whom he persuaded
that the Holy Spirit was his Father, and his Mother a Virgin.<a class=

These good people being accustomed to be satisfied with dreams and

willingly that a birth out of the natural order was not so marvelous a
circumstance for them to believe. To be born of a <span class=

above others. If he was more unfortunate, he was no less adroit, and
several places in his history give evidence that the greatest fault in
his policy was not to have sufficiently provided for his own safety. So
it may be seen that he did not manage his affairs any better than those
two other legislators, of whose memory exists but the remains of the

a little hamlet in Judea, and that his mother was a poor villager who
only existed by her labor. Having been convicted of adultery with a

who was a carpenter by trade, who condoned their offence, and they
wandered miserably from place to place. She was secretly delivered of
Jesus, and finding themselves in want, they were constrained to flee to
Egypt. After several years, his services being of no value to the
Egyptians, he returned to his own country, where, quite proud of the
miracles he knew how to perform, he proclaimed himself <i>God</i>.</p>

<p class="par first">Such were the skillful and witty evasions of the
destroyer of the ancient law and the founder of the new. Such were the
origins of the new religion which was built on the ruins of the old, or
to speak disinterestedly, there was nothing more divine in this than in
the other sects which preceded it. Its founder, who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span>was not
quite ignorant, seeing the extreme corruption of the Jewish republic,
judged it as nearing its end, and believed that another should be
revived from its ashes. The fear of being prevented by one more
ambitious than himself, made him haste to establish it by methods quite
opposed to those of Moses. The latter commenced by making himself
formidable to other nations. Jesus, on the contrary, attracted them to
him by the hope of the advantages of another life, which he said could
be obtained by believing in him, while Moses only promised temporal
benefits as a recompense for the observation of <i>his</i> law. Jesus
Christ held out a hope which never was realized. The laws of one only
regarded the exterior, while those of the other aimed at the inner man,
influencing even the thoughts, and entirely the reverse of the law of
Moses. Whence it follows that Jesus believed with <i>Aristotle</i> that
it is with Religion and States, as with individuals who are begotten
and die, and as nothing is made except subject to dissolution, there is
no law which can follow which is entirely opposed to it. Now as it is
difficult to decide to change from one law to another, and as the great
majority is difficult to move in matters of Religion, Jesus, in
imitation of the other innovators had recourse to <i>miracles</i>,
which have always been the peril of the ignorant, and the sanctuary of
the ambitious.</p>

<p class="par first">As for his <i>Morals</i>, we see nothing more
divine therein than in the writings of the ancients, or rather we find
only what are only extracts or imitations. <i>St. Augustin</i> (ch. 9
and v. 20 of the Confessions, Book 7,) even admits that he has found in
some of their works nearly all of the beginning of the Gospel according
to <i>St. John</i>. As far as may be seen, that Apostle is believed, in
many places, to have stolen from other authors, and that it was not
difficult to rob the Prophets of their enigmas and visions to make his
<i>Apocalypse</i>. Whence comes the conformity which we find between
the doctrine of the Old Testament and that of <i>Plato</i>? to say
nothing of what the Rabbins have done, and those who have fabricated
the <i>Holy Writings</i> from a mass of fragments stolen from this
Grand Philosopher.</p>
<p class="par">Certainly the birth of the world has a thousand times
more probability in his <i>Timaeus</i> than in Genesis, and it cannot
be said that that comes from what <i>Plato</i> had <i>read</i> in the
books of the Jews during his travels in Egypt, for according to <i>St.
Augustin</i> himself, (Confessions, Book 7, ch. 9, v. 20,)
<i>Ptolemy</i> had not yet translated them. The description of the
country of which <i>Socrates</i> speaks to <i>Simias</i> in the
<i>Phaedon</i> (<i>?</i>) has infinitely more grace than the
<i>Terrestrial Paradise</i> (of Eden) and the
<i>Androgynus</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3227src" href="#xd21e3227"

conceived than what <i>Genesis</i> says of the extraction of Eve from
one of the sides of Adam. Is there anything that more resembles the two
accidents of <i>Sodom</i> and <i>Gomorrah</i> than that which happened
to <i>Phaeton</i>? Is there anything more alike than the fall of
<i>Lucifer</i> and that of <i>Vulcan</i>, or that of the giants cast
down by the lightnings of Jupiter? Anything more similar than
<i>Samson</i> and <i>Hercules</i>, <i>Elijah</i> and <i>Phaeton</i>,
<i>Joseph</i> and <i>Hippolitus</i>, <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> and
<i>Lycaon</i>, <i>Tantalus</i> and the tormented rich man (<a class=

<i>Jonah</i> with <i>Hercules</i>, surnamed <i>Trinsitium</i>
(?Trinoctius), because he had dwelt three days and three nights in the
belly of a whale. The <i>river of Daniel</i>, spoken of in the

<p class="par first">But it seems that I have made quite a digression
which, however, may not be unprofitable. Let us return then to Jesus,
or rather, to his <i>Morals</i>.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Celsus</i> proves, by the account of <i>Origen</i>
(Book VI, against <i>Celsus</i>), that he had taken from <i>Plato</i>
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>finest sentiments, such as that which says
(<i>Luke</i>, c. xviii, v. 25), <i>that a camel might sooner pass
through the eye of a needle than a rich man should enter the Kingdom of
God</i>. It was the <i>sect of Pharisees</i> of which he was, and who
believed in him, which gave birth to this. What is said of the
<i>Immortality of the Soul</i>, of the <i>Resurrection</i>, of
<i>Hell</i>, and the greater part of his <i>Morals</i>, I see nothing
more admirable than in the works of <i>Epictetus</i>, <i>Epicurus</i>
and many others. In fact, the latter was cited by <i>St. Jerome</i>
(Book VIII, against <i>Jovian</i>, ch. viii), <i>as a man whose virtue
puts to the blush better Christians, observing that all his works were
filled with but herbs, fruits and abstinence, and whose delights were
so temperate that his finest repasts were but a little cheese, bread
and water</i>. With a life so frugal, this Philosopher, pagan as he
was, said that it was <i>better to be unlucky and rational, than rich
and opulent without having good sense</i>, adding, <i>that it is rare
that fortune and wisdom are found in the same individual</i>, and
<i>that one could have no knowledge of happiness nor live with pleasure
unless felicity was accompanied by prudence, justice and honesty, which
are qualifications of a true and lasting delight</i>.</p>
<p class="par">As for <i>Epictetus</i> I do not believe that any man,
not excepting <i>Jesus</i> himself, was more austere, more firm, more
equitable, or more moral. I say nothing but what is easy to prove, and
not to pass my prescribed limit I will not mention all the exemplary
acts of his life, but give one single example of constancy which puts
to shame the weakness and cowardice of <i>Jesus</i> in the sight of
death. Being a slave to a freeman named <i>Epaphroditus</i>, captain of
the guards of Nero, it took the fancy of this brute to twist the leg of
Epictetus. Epictetus perceiving that it gave him pleasure said to him,
smiling, that he was well convinced that the game <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>would
not end until he had broken his leg; in fact, this crisis happened.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Epictetus with an even smiling face,
&ldquo;did I not say that you would break my leg?&rdquo; Was there ever
courage equal to that? and could it have been said of <i>Jesus
Christ</i> had he been the victim? He who wept and trembled with fear
at the least alarm, and who evinced at his death a lack of spirit that
never was witnessed in the majority of his martyrs.</p>
<p class="par">I doubt not but what it might be said of this action of
<i>Epictetus</i> what the ignorant remark of the virtues of the
Philosophers, that vanity was their principle, and that they were not
what they seemed. But I say also that those who use such language are
people who, in the pulpit, say all that comes into their
heads&mdash;either good or evil&mdash;and they want the privilege of
telling it all. I know also that when these babblers, sellers of air,
wind and smoke, have vented all their strength against the champions of
common sense they think they have well earned the revenues of their
livings: that they have not merited a call to instruct the people
unless they have declared against those who know what common sense and
true virtue is.</p>
<p class="par">So it is true that nothing in the world approaches so
little to the manners of true scholars as the actions of the ignorant
who decry them and who appear to have studied only to procure
preferment which gives them bread; and which preferment they worship
and magnify when this height is attained, as if they had reached a
condition of perfection, which, to those who succeed, is a condition of
self-love, ease, pride and pleasure, following nothing less than the
maxims of the religion which they profess.</p>
<p class="par">But let us leave these people who know not what virtue
is, and examine the divinity of their Master. <span class=

<p class="par first">After having examined his policy and morals we
have seen nothing more Divine than in the writings and conduct of the
ancients. Let us see if the reputation which followed him after his
death is an evidence that he was God. Mankind is so accustomed to false
reasoning that I am astonished that any one can reach a sane conclusion
from their conduct. Experience shows that there is nothing they
followed that is in any wise true, and that nothing has been done or
said by them which gives any evidence of stability. In the meanwhile it
is certain that common opinions are continually surrounded with
chimeras notwithstanding the efforts of the learned, which have always
opposed them. Whatever care has been taken to extirpate follies the
people have never abandoned them only after having been surfeited with
them. Moses was proud to boast himself the Lieutenant of the Lord of
Lords, and to prove his mission by extraordinary signs. If ever so
little he absented himself (which he did from time to time to confer,
as he said, with his God, as <i>Numa</i> and other lawgivers also did)
he only found on his return traces of the worship of the Gods which the
Israelites had seen in Egypt. He successfully held them forty years in
the wilderness that they might lose the idea of those they had
abandoned, and not being yet satisfied they obeyed him who led them,
and bore firmly whatever hardship they were caused to suffer in this
regard. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=

<p class="par">Only the hatred which they had conceived for other
nations, by an arrogance of which most idiots are susceptible, made
them insensibly forget the Gods of Egypt and attach themselves to those
of <i>Moses</i> whom they adored, and sometimes with all the
circumstance marked in the laws. But when they quitted these conditions
little by little to follow those of <i>Jesus Christ</i>, I cannot see
what inconstancy caused them to run after the novelty and change.</p>

that one hopes will smooth the difficulties. Thus the Disciples of
Jesus, miserable as they were, reduced at times to nourish themselves
with grains of corn which they gathered from the fields (Luke vi., 1),
and seeing themselves shamefully excluded from places where they
thought to enter to ease their fatigue (Luke ix., 52&ndash;53) they
began to be discouraged with living; their Master being without the
pale of the law and unable to give them the benefits, glory and
grandeur which he had promised them.</p>
<p class="par">After his death his disciples, in despair at seeing
their hopes frustrated, and pursued by the Jews who wished to treat
them as they had treated their Master, made a virtue of necessity and
scattered over the country, where by the report of some women
(<a class="biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

18</a>) they told of his resurrection, his divine affiliation and the
rest of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=

filled.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3489src" href="#xd21e3489" name=
"xd21e3489src">1</a> The trouble which they had to make progress among
the <i>Jews</i> made them resolve to pass among the <i>Gentiles</i>,
and try to serve themselves better among them; but as it was necessary
to have more learning for that than they possessed&mdash;the Gentiles
being philosophers and too much in love with truth to resort to
trifles&mdash;they gained over a young man (Saul or St. Paul) of an
active and eager mind and a little better informed than the simple
fishermen or than the greater babblers who associated with them. A
stroke from Heaven made him blind, as is said (without this the trick
would have been useless) and this incident for a time attracted some
weak souls.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3505src" href="#xd21e3505" name=
"xd21e3505src">2</a> By the fear of Hell, taken from some of the fables
of the ancient poets, and by the hope of a glorious <i>Resurrection</i>
and a <i>Paradise</i> which is hardly more supportable than that of
<i>Mahomet</i>; all these procured for their <i>Master</i> the honor of
passing for a God, which he himself was unable to obtain while living.
In which this kind of <i>Jesus</i> was no better than <i>Homer</i>: six
cities which had driven the latter out with contempt and scorn during
his life, disputed with each other after his death to determine with
whom remained the honor of having been his birth-place.</p>
<p class="par">By this it may be seen that Christianity depends, like
all other things, on the caprice of men, in whose opinion all passes
either for good or bad, according as the notion strikes them. Further,
if Jesus was God, nothing could resist him, for St. Paul (Romans, v.
19), is witness that nothing could overcome his will. Yet <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>this
passage is directly opposed to another in Genesis (iv, 7), where it is
said that as the <i>desires and appetites of man belong to him, who is
the Master</i>, so it is agreed to accord free-will to the master of
animals, that is to say, man, for whom it is said God has created the
universe.</p>
<p class="par">But without wandering in a maze of errors and positive
contradictions, of which we have discoursed sufficiently, let us say
something of <i>Mahomet</i>, who founded a law upon maxims totally
opposed to those of <i>Jesus Christ</i>.</p>

<p class="par first">Hardly had the Disciples of Jesus abandoned the
Mosaic law to introduce the Christian, than mankind, with their usual
caprice and ordinary inconstancy, suddenly changed their sentiments,
and all the East was seen embracing the sentiments of the celebrated
<i>Arius</i>, who had the boldness to oppose the fable of Jesus, and
prove that he was no more a God than any other man. Thus Christianity
was almost abolished, and there appeared a new law-giver, who, in less
than ten years time, formed a considerable sect. This was
<i>Mahomet</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3566src" href="#xd21e3566"
name="xd21e3566src">1</a></p>
<p class="par">To be well acquainted with him, it must be known that
the part of <i>Arabia</i> where he was born, was commonly called
&ldquo;the Happy,&rdquo; by reason of its fertility, and being
inhabited by people who formed several Republics, each Republic being a
family called a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span>&ldquo;tribe,&rdquo; and having for its head the
chief of the principal family, among those which composed the
&ldquo;tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">That in which <i>Mahomet</i> was born was named the
Tribe of <i>Koreish</i>, of which the principal family was that of
<i>Hashem</i>, of which the chief was then a certain <i>Abdul
Motallab</i>,<a class="noteref" id="n89.1src" href="#n89.1" name=
"n89.1src">2</a> grandfather of <i>Mahomet</i>, whose father, eldest
son of <i>Abdul Motallab</i>, was named <i>Abdallah</i>.<a class=
"pseudonoteref" href="#n89.1">2</a></p>
<p class="par">This tribe inhabited the shores of the Red sea, and
<i>Abdul Motallab</i> was High Priest of the Temple of Mecca where were
worshipped the Idols of the country. As Chief of his Tribe he was
Prince of this country in which quality he had sustained the war
against the King of Persia and the Emperor of Ethiopia, which shows
that <i>Mahomet</i> was not of the riff-raff of the people.</p>
<p class="par">His father dying before his grandfather, his tender
years caused him to lose the rights he had to the Sovereignty, which
one of his uncles usurped. It was for this reason, not being able to
succeed to the title of Prince, that he was reduced to the humble
condition of shop-boy in the employ of a wealthy widow for whom he
became afterwards factor. Having found him to her liking she married
him and made him one of the richest citizens of Mecca. He was then
about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>30 years of age, and seeing at hand the means to
enforce his rights, his ambitions awakened, and he meditated in what
manner he could re-establish himself in the dignity of his
grandfather.</p>
<p class="par">The correspondence that he had had with
<i>Christians</i> in <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Jews</i> in <i>Judea</i>,
where he had traded a long time for his wife while he was only her
factor, gave him an opportunity of knowing who Moses was and also Jesus
Christ. He also had remarked into how many different sects their
Religion was divided, and which produced such diversity of opinions,
and the zeal of each sect. By this he profited, and he believed he
could better succeed in the interest of establishing a new Religion.
The conditions of the time when he formed this design were very
favorable to him, for nearly all of the Arabs, disgusted with the
worship of their Idols, were fallen into a species of <i>Atheism</i>.
Thus Mahomet began by leading a retired life, being exemplary, seeking
solitude, and passing the greater part of the day in prayers and
meditations. He caused himself to be admired for his modest demeanor,
and commenced to speak of revelations and visions. By such action is
gained the credence of the populace, and by such methods Moses and
Jesus commenced. He called himself a prophet and an envoy of God, and
having as much skill as his predecessors in working miracles, he soon
gained attention, then admiration, and soon after the confidence of the
people. A <i>Jew</i> and a <i>Christian monk</i> who were in his
conspiracy aided him in his dextrous moves, and he soon became powerful
enough to resist a <i>vigorous man</i> named <i>Corais</i>, a learned
Arab, who endeavored to expose his imposture.</p>
<p class="par">During this time his uncle, the governor of Mecca, died,
and not being yet strong enough to assume the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>authority of sovereign, he was obliged to yield to
one of his kinsmen who, penetrating his designs, obliged him to flee
from <i>Mecca</i> and take refuge at <i>Medina</i>, where one party in
the city who were Arian Christians joined him.</p>
<p class="par">Then he ceased to support his authority by argument, and
persuaded his disciples to plant the Mussulman faith at the point of
the sword. Having strengthened his party by alliances, marrying his
daughters to four of the principal citizens of <i>Medina</i>, he was in
condition to place armies in the field who subjugated the various
tribes, one after the other, and with whom he finally seized
<i>Mecca</i>. He did not die until after he had accomplished his
purpose by his hypocrisy and imposture, which elevated him to the
dignity of sovereign, which he transmitted to his successors, and his
faith so well established that there has been no evidence of its
failure for six hundred years, and yet it may be upon the eve of its
destruction.</p>

<p class="par first">Thus Mahomet was more fortunate than Jesus Christ.
After having labored during twenty-three years in the establishment of
his Law and Religion, he saw its progress before his death, and having
an assurance which Jesus Christ had not, that it would exist a long
time after his death, since he prudently accommodated the genius and
passions of his followers.</p>
<p class="par">Such was the last of these three impostors. Moses threw
himself into an abyss by an excess of ambition to cause himself to be
believed immortal. Jesus Christ was ignominiously hung up between two
thieves, being covered with shame as a recompense for his imposture,
and lastly, Mahomet died in reality in his own bed, and <span class=

of the celebrated <i>Golius</i> having asked what the <i>Mahometans</i>
said of their prophet, this wise professor sent him the following
extract which contains an abridgement of the life of that Impostor
taken from a manuscript in the Turkish language: &ldquo;The Lord
<i>Mahomet Mustapha</i>, of glorious memory, the greatest of the
Prophets, was born in the fortieth year of the Empire of <i>Anal
Schirwan</i>, the Just. His holy nativity happened the twelfth day in
the second third of the month Rabia. Now, after the fortieth year of
his age had passed, he was divinely inspired, received the crown of
prophecy and the robe of Legation, which were brought him from God by
the faithful messenger Gabriel, with instructions to call mankind to
<i>Islamism</i>. After this inspiration from God was received, he dwelt
at <i>Mecca</i> for thirteen years. He left there aged fifty-three
years the eighth day of the month <i>Rabia</i>, which was a Friday, and
took refuge at <i>Medina</i>. Now, it was there, after his retreat the
twentieth day of the eleventh month, and the sixty-third year of his
blessed life, he succeeded to the enjoyment of the divine presence.
Some say that he was born while <i>Abelaka</i>,<a class="pseudonoteref"
href="#n89.1">2</a> his father, was yet living, others say after his
death. Lady <i>Amina</i>, a daughter of the <i>Wahabees</i>, gave him
for nurse lady <i>Halima</i>, of the tribe of <i>Beni-Saad</i>. <i>Abdo
Imutalib</i>,<a class="pseudonoteref" href="#n89.1">2</a> his
grandfather, gave him the blessed name of <i>Mahomet</i>. He had four
sons and four daughters. The sons were <i>Kasim</i>, <i>Ibrahim</i>,
<i>Thajib</i> and <i>Thahir</i>, and the daughters, <i>Fatima</i>,
<i>Omokeltum</i>, <i>Rakia</i> and <i>Zeineb</i>. The companions of

immaterial substance; others, a kind of divinity; some, a very subtile
air, and others a harmony of all parts of the body. Again, others have
remarked that it is the most subtile and fine part of the blood, which
is separated from it in the brain and is distributed by the nerves: so
that the source of the Soul is the heart where it is produced, and the
place where it performs its noblest function is the Brain, because
there it is well purified from the grosser parts of the blood. These
are the principal opinions which have been held concerning the Soul,
but to render them more perceptible let us divide them into

the soul is <i>spiritual</i>, that is to say, a being capable of
existence without the aid of the body, and can move itself: that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=

portions of the <i>universal soul</i> of the world: that these portions

the great fire at which they have been kindled.</p>

<p class="par first">These philosophers believed the animated universe
a substance, spiritual, immortal and invisible, pursuing always that
which attracts, which is the source of all movements, and of all Souls
which are small particles of it. Now, as Souls are very pure, and
infinitely superior to the body, they do not unite immediately, but by
means of a subtile body, such as flame, or that subtile and extensive
air which the vulgar take for heaven. Afterwards they take a body less
subtile, then another a little more impure, and always thus by degrees,
until they can unite with the sensible bodies of animals, whence
(<i>sic</i>) they descend like into dungeons or sepulchres. The death
of the body, they say, is the life of the soul wherein it was buried,
and where it exercises but weakly its most beautiful functions.</p>
<p class="par">Thus at the death of the body the soul comes out of its
prison untrammelled by matter, and reunites with the soul of the
universe, from whence it came. Thus, following this thought, all the
Souls of animals are of the same nature, and the diversity of their
functions comes only from the difference in the bodies that they
enter.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Aristotle</i> admits further, a universal
understanding common to all beings, and which acts in regard to
particular intelligences as light does in regard to the eyes; and as
light makes objects visible, the universal understanding makes objects
intelligible. This philosopher <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98"
href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>defines the Soul as that which
makes us live, feel, think and move, but he does not say what the Being
is that is the source and principle of these noble functions, and
consequently we must not look to him to dispel the doubt which exists
concerning the Nature of the Soul.</p>

<p class="par first"><i>Dicearchus</i>, <i>Asclesiade</i> (?
Esculapius), and in some ways <i>Galen</i>, have also believed the soul
to be incorporeal, but in another manner, for they have said that it is
nothing more than the harmony of all parts of the body, that is to say,
that which results in an exact blending and disposition of the humors
and spirits. Thus, they say, health is not a part of him who is well,
however it be his condition, so that, however, the soul be in the
animal, it is not one of its parts, but a mutual accord of all of which
it is composed. On which it is remarked that these authors believe the
soul to be incorporeal, on a principle quite opposed to their intent,
by saying that it is <i>not</i> a body, but only something inseparably
attached <i>to</i> a body, that is to say, in good reasoning, that it
is quite corporeal, since corporeality is not only that which <i>is</i>
a body, but <i>all</i> which is <i>form</i> or <i>accident</i> that
cannot be separated from matter.</p>
<p class="par">These are the philosophers who have believed the soul
incorporeal or immaterial, who, as you see, are not in accord with
themselves, and consequently do not merit any belief. Let us now
consider those who have avowed it to be a <i>body</i>.</p>

in that composition there enters some air, a vapor, and another

<p class="par first">Not to shuffle, as all these philosophers have
done, and to have as perfect an idea as is possible of the souls of
animals, let us admit that in all, without excepting man, it is of the
same nature, and has no different functions, but by reason of the
diversity of organs and humors; hence we must believe what follows.</p>
<p class="par">It is certain that there is in the universe a very
subtile spirit, or a very delicate matter, and always in motion, the
source of which is in the <i>Sun</i>, and the remainder is spread in
all the other bodies, more or less, according to Nature or their
consistency. That is the Soul of the Universe which governs and
vivifies it, and of which some portion is distributed among all the
parts that compose it. This Soul, and the most pure Fire which is in
the universe does not burn of itself, but by the different movements
that it gives to the particles of other bodies where it enters, it
burns and reflects its heat. The visible fire has more of this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>spirit than air, the latter more than water, and
the earth much less than the latter. Among the mixed bodies, plants
have more than minerals, and animals more than either. To conclude,
this fire being enclosed in the body, it is rendered capable of
thought, and that is what is called the soul, or what is called animal
spirits, which are spread in all parts of the body. Now, it is certain
that this soul being of the same nature in all animals, disperses at
the death of man in the same manner as in other animals, from whence it
follows that what Poets and Theologians sing or preach of the other
world, is a chimera which they have invented, and which they narrate
for reasons that are easy to guess.</p>

<p class="par first">We have fully commented on how the belief in
Spirits was introduced among men, and how these Spirits were but
phantoms which existed in their imagination. The ancient Philosophers
were not sufficiently clear to explain to the people what these
phantoms were, and did not allow themselves to say that they could
<i>raise</i> them. Some seeing that these phantoms dissolved and had no
consistency, called them <i>immaterial</i>, <i>incorporeal</i>, forms
without matter, or colors and figures, without being, nevertheless,
bodies either colored or defined, adding that they could cover
themselves with air like a mantle when they wished to render themselves
visible to the eyes of men. Others said that they were animated bodies,
but were composed of air, or some other more subtile matter which
condensed at their will when they wished to appear.</p>

<p class="par first">These two kinds of Philosophers being opposed in
the opinion which they had of phantoms, agreed in the name which they
gave them, for all called them <i>Demons</i>, in which they were but
little more enlightened than those who believed they saw in their sleep
the souls of the dead, and that it is their soul which they see when
they look in a mirror, and who also believed that they saw (reflected)
in the water the souls of the stars. After this foolish fancy they fell
into an error which is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href=
"#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>hardly less supportable, that is,
the current idea that these phantoms had infinite power. An absurd but

<p class="par first">This ridiculous opinion was no sooner published
than the Sovereigns began to use it to support their power. They
established a belief concerning spirits which they called
<i>Religion</i>, so that the fear which the people possessed for
invisible powers would hold them to their obedience. To have it carry
more influence they distinguished the demons as good and bad. The
latter to encourage men to obey their laws, and the former to restrain
and prevent them from infringing them. Now to learn what these demons
were it is only necessary to read the Greek poets and their histories,
and above all what <i>Hesiod</i> says in his <i>Theogony</i> where he
fully treats of the origin and propagation of the Gods.</p>

<p class="par first">The Greeks were the first who invented them, and
by them they were propagated through the medium of their colonies, and
their conquests in Asia, Egypt and Italy. The Jews who were dispersed
in Alexandria and elsewhere got their acquaintance with them from the
Greeks. They used them as effectively as the other peoples but with
this difference, they did not call them <i>Demons</i> like the Greeks,
but <i>good</i> and <i>bad</i> spirits; reserving for the <i>good
Demons</i> the name of <i>Spirit of God</i>, and calling those
<i>Prophets</i> who were said to possess this good spirit called the
Divine, which they held as responsible for great blessings, and
<i>cacodaemons</i> or <i>Evil spirits</i> on the contrary those which
were provocative of <i>great Evil</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par first">This distinction of good and evil made them name
as <i>Demoniacs</i> those whom we call lunatics, visionaries, madmen
and epileptics, and those who spoke to them in an unknown tongue. A man
ill-shaped and of evil look was to their notion possessed of an
<i>unclean spirit</i>, and a mute of a <i>dumb spirit</i>. Now, these
words <i>spirit</i> and <i>demon</i> became so familiar to them that
they spoke of them on all occasions, so that it is evident that the
Jews believed like the Greeks, that these phantoms were not mere
chimeras and visions, but real beings that existed independent of
imagination.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">So it happens that the Bible is quite filled with
these words <i>Spirits</i>, <i>Demons</i> and <i>Fiends</i>, but
nowhere is it said when they were first known, nor the time of their
creation, which is hardly pardonable in Moses, who is earnest in
depicting the Creation of Heaven, Earth and Man. No more then is Jesus
Christ who had such close intimacy with them, who commanded them so
absolutely according to the Gospel, and who spoke so often of angels
and good and bad spirits, but without saying whether they were
corporeal or spiritual; which makes it plain that he knew no more than
the Greeks had taught other nations, in which he is not less culpable
than for denying to all men the virtue of faith and piety which he
professed to be able to give them.</p>
<p class="par">But to return to the Spirits. It is certain that the
words <i>Demon</i>, <i>Satan</i> and <i>Devil</i>, are not proper names
which designated any individual, and which never have any credence but
among the ignorant; as much among the Greeks who invented them, as
among the Jews where they were tolerated. So the latter being overrun
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>by them gave them names&mdash;which signified
<i>enemy</i>, <i>accuser</i>, <i>inquisitor</i>,&mdash;as well to
invisible powers as to their own adversaries, the Gentiles, whom they
said inhabited the Kingdom of Satan; there being none but themselves,
in their own opinion, who dwelt in that of God.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">VII.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As Jesus Christ was a Jew, and consequently imbued
with these silly opinions, we read everywhere in the Gospels, and in
the writings of his Disciples, of the <i>Devil</i>, of <i>Satan</i> and
<i>Hell</i> as if they were something real and effective. While it is
true, as we have shown, that there is nothing more imaginary, and when
what we have said is not sufficient to prove it, but two words will
suffice to convince the most obstinate. All Christians agree
unanimously that God is the first principle and the foundation of all
things, that he has created and preserves them, and without his support
they would fall into nothingness. Following this principle it is
certain that God must have created what is called the <i>Devil</i>, and
<i>Satan</i>, as well as the rest, and if he has created both good and
evil, why not all the balance, and if by this principle all evil
exists, it can only be by the intervention of God.</p>
<p class="par">Now can one conceive that God would maintain a creature,
not only who curses him unceasingly, and who mortally hates him, but
even who endeavors to corrupt his friends, to have the pleasure of
being cursed by a multitude of mouths. How can we comprehend that God
should preserve the Devil to have him do his worst to dethrone him if
he could, and to alienate from his service his elect and his favorites?
What would be the object of God in such conduct? Now what can we say in
speaking of the Devil and Hell. If God does <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>all,
and nothing can be done without him how does it happen that the Devil
hates him, curses him, and takes away his friends? Now he is either
agreeable, or he is not. If he <i>is</i> agreeable, it is certain that
the Devil in cursing him only does what he should, since he can only do
what God wills. Consequently, it is not the Devil, but God in person
who curses himself; a situation to my idea more absurd than ever.</p>
<p class="par">If it is not in accord with his will then it is not true
that he is all powerful. Thus there are two principles, one of Good,
the other of Evil, one which causes one thing and the other that does
quite the contrary. To what does this reasoning lead us? To avow
without contradiction that there is no God such as is conceived, nor
Devil, nor Soul, nor Paradise, such as has been depicted, and that the
Theologians, that is to say, those who relate fables for truth, are
persons of bad faith who maliciously abuse the credulity of the
ignorant by telling them what they please, as if the people were
capable of nothing but chimera or who should be fed with insipid food
in which is found only emptiness, nothingness and folly, and not a
grain of the salt of truth and wisdom. Centuries have passed, one after
the other, in which mankind has been infatuated by these absurd
imaginations which have been combatted; but during all the period there
have also been found sincere minds who have written against the
injustice of the Doctors in Tiaras, Mitres and Gowns, who have kept
mankind in such deplorable blindness which seems to increase every
day.</p>

<p class="par first">Hardly had the disciples of Christ abolished the
Mosaic law to introduce the Christian dispensation, than mankind,
carried away by force, and by their ordinary inconstancy, followed a
new law-giver, who advanced himself by the same methods as Moses. He
assumed, like him, the title of prophet, and envoy of God, like him he
performed miracles and knew how to profit by the passions of the
people. First he was accompanied by an ignorant rabble, to whom he
explained the new oracles of heaven. These unfortunates, seduced by the
promises and fables of this new impostor, spread his renown and exalted
him to a height that eclipsed his predecessors. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Mahomet was not a man who appeared capable of founding
an empire, as he excelled neither in politics<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e4224src" href="#xd21e4224" name="xd21e4224src">1</a> nor
philosophy; in fact, could neither read nor write. He had so little
firmness that he would often have abandoned his enterprise had he not
been forced to persist in his undertaking by the skill of one of his
followers. From that time he commenced to rise and become celebrated.
Corais, a powerful Arab, jealous that a man of his birth should have
the audacity to deceive the people, declared himself his enemy, and
attempted to cross his enterprise, but the people persuaded that
Mahomet had continual conferences with God and his angels caused him to
prevail over his enemy. The tribe of Corais were at a disadvantage and
Mahomet seeing himself followed by a crazy crowd who thought him a
divine man, thought he would have no need of a companion, but fearing
that the latter (Corais) might expose his impostures he tried to
prevent it, and to do it more certainly he overwhelmed him with
promises, and swore to him that he wished only to become great by
sharing the power to which he had contributed. &ldquo;We have
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>reached,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the moment of
our elevation, we are sure of the great multitude we have gained, and
we must now assure ourselves by the artifice you have so happily
conceived.&rdquo; At the same time he induced him to hide himself in
the cave of oracles. There was a dried-up well from which he made the
people believe that the voice of God declared himself for Mahomet, who
was in the midst of his proselytes. Deceived by the caresses of this
traitor, his associate went into the well to counterfeit the oracle as
usual; Mahomet then passing by at the head of an infatuated multitude a
voice was heard saying: &ldquo;I who am your God, declare that I have
established Mahomet as the prophet of all nations: from him you will
learn my true law which has been changed by the Jews and the
Christians.&rdquo; For a long time this man played this game, but in
the end he was paid by the greatest and blackest ingratitude. Mahomet
hearing the voice which proclaimed him a divine being, turned towards
the people and commanded them in the name of the God who recognized him
as his prophet, to fill with stones the ditch from whence had issued
such authentic testimony in his favor, in memory of the stone which
Jacob raised to mark the place where God appeared to him.<a class=

Thus perished the unfortunate person who had contributed to the
elevation of Mahomet; it was on this heap of stones that the last of
the celebrated prophets established his law. This foundation is so
stable and founded in such a way that after a thousand years of reign
it has no appearance of being overthrown. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

&ldquo;Mahomet,&rdquo; says the Count de Boulainvilliers, &ldquo;was
ignorant of common knowledge, as I believe, but he assuredly knew much
of what a great traveler might acquire with much native wit, when he
employed it usefully. He was not ignorant of his own language, the use
of which, and not by reading, taught him its nicety and beauty. He was
not ignorant of the art of knowing how to render odious what was truly
culpable, and to portray the truth with simple and lively colors in a
manner which could not be forgotten. In fact, all that he has said is
true in comparison with the essential dogmas of religion, but he has
not said all that is true. It is in that particular alone that our
Religion differs from his.&rdquo; He adds further on, &ldquo;that
Mahomet was neither rude nor barbarous, that he conducted his
enterprise with all the art, delicacy, constancy, intrepidity, and all
the other great qualities which would have actuated Alexander or Cesar
were they in his place.&rdquo; <i>Life of Mahomet, by Count de

<p class="par">Many maintain that there is a God, and that he should be
worshipped, before they understand either what a God is, or what it is
to be, as far as being is common to bodies and spirits, according to
the distinction they make; and what it is to worship God, although they
regard the worship of God according to the standard of the honor given
to ruling men.</p>
<p class="par">What God is, they describe according to the confession
of their own ignorance. For it is inevitable that they declare how he
differs from other things by the denial of former conceptions. They
cannot comprehend that there is an infinite being; that is, one of
whose limits they are ignorant. There is a creator of heaven and earth,
they say, but who is <i>his</i> creator they do not say, because they
do not know; because they do not understand. Some say that he is the
origin of himself and maintain that he comes from nothing but himself.
We do not understand his origin they say, therefore he has none (why
so? if we do not understand God himself, is there, therefore, no God?)
And this is the first principle of their ignorance.</p>
<p class="par">There is no progression into infinity; why not? because
the human intellect must have some foundation? because it is accustomed
to this belief? because it cannot imagine anything beyond its own
limits? As if, indeed, it followed, that if I do not comprehend
infinity, therefore there is no infinity.</p>
<p class="par">And nevertheless as is known from experience, some among
the members of the sects of Christ, think <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>there is an infinite
progression of divine properties or persons, concerning the limitations
of which, however, there has hitherto been dispute, and so indeed they
think that there is a progression <i>into</i> infinity. For the son is
begotten from infinity, and the holy spirit is breathed from infinity.
This begetting and this procession goes on to infinity. For if that
begetting or that breathing of the spirit had begun or should once have
ceased, the conception of eternity would be destroyed. But if you
should agree with them on this point also, that the creation of man can
not be prolonged to infinity, which they infer, however, on account of
their finite minds, it will not yet be evident whether other beings
have not been begotten among the higher powers, in a peculiar manner
and in great number, as well as among men on earth; and who of this
great number should especially be accepted as God. For every religion
admits that there are Gods who are mediators, although they are not all
under equal limitations, whence that principle, that there must be one
being only, raised above men by his own nature, is evidently
demolished. And so it will be possible to say that from a diversity of
Gods as creators, a diversity of religions, and a variety of kinds of
worship afterwards arose: which the religious feeling of the heathen
especially employed. But as to the objection which is raised about the
murders and the concubinage of the Pagan Gods, aside from the fact that
the Pagans have long since shown that these things must be understood
as mysteries, similar things will be found in other religions.</p>
<p class="par">The slaughter of many tribes was perpetrated by Moses
and Joshua at the command of God. Even human sacrifice the God of
Israel demanded of Abraham, but it was not carried into effect in this
remarkable case. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114"
name="pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">But he could either not have given a command, or Abraham
could not have believed that it had been given in earnest, which would
have been in itself utterly at variance with the nature of God. Mahomet
promises the whole world as the reward offered by his religion, and
Christians talk about the universal slaughter of their enemies and the
subjugation of the foes of the church, which indeed has not been
insignificant, from the fact that the church had the entire control of

<p class="par">Was not polygamy also permitted by (Mohammed) Moses, and
as some maintain, even in the New Testament, by Christ? Did not the
Holy Spirit beget the son of God by a peculiar union with a betrothed
virgin?</p>
<p class="par">As for other objections which are made to the pagans
about their ridiculous idols, and their misuse of worship, they are not
so weighty that similar ones can not be made to the members of other
sects; nevertheless it can easily be proved that these abuses have
proceeded from the subordinates rather than from the leaders, from the
disciples, rather than from the masters of religions.</p>
<p class="par">But to return to the former argument. This
<i>being</i>,&mdash;since the intellect limits its extent,&mdash;is
what some call Nature and others God. On these points some agree,
others disagree. Some fancy that the worlds have existed from eternity,
and call the connection of things God; certain ones call God an
individual being, which can be neither seen or known, although among
these disputes are not infrequent.</p>
<p class="par">Religion, as far as it concerns worship, some attribute
to the fear, some to the love, of invisible powers. But if the
invisible powers are false, idolatry is just as the principles of each
worshipper demand. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115"
name="pb115">115</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">They will have it that love springs from kindness and
refer it to gratitude; although nevertheless it chiefly arises from the
sympathy of humors. The kind deeds of enemies inspire especially
violent hatred although no one of the hypocrites has dared to confess
it. But who would suppose that love arises from the kindness of him who
gave to man the characteristics of a lion, a bear and other wild beasts
that he might assume a nature contrary to the will of the creator? Who,
well knowing the weakness of human nature, placed before [our
progenitors] a tree, by which he was sure they would bring a fatal
sentence upon themselves and their descendants (as some will have it)?
And yet the latter are bound to worship and to perform deeds of
gratitude, as if for a great favor, Forsooth! So the <i>Ithacan</i> may
have it, <i>etc.</i> Take deadly arms, a sword for instance, and if you
had the most certain foreknowledge (which some claim for God also in
this very case, inasmuch as there can be no chance with God) of the
very purpose that he, before whose eyes you place it, will seize it and
inflict on himself and all his descendants the most dreadful death. (He
who has still one drop of the milk of human kindness will shudder to do
such a deed). Take, I say, a sword, you who are a father, for instance,
or you who are a friend; and if you are a father, if you are a real
friend, present it to your friend, or your children, with the command
that they should <i>not</i> run upon it, you foreseeing beyond all
doubt, nevertheless, that he <i>will</i> run upon it, and inflict on
his children and those hitherto innocent, the most dreadful death.
Consider, you who are a father, would you do such a thing? What is it
to make a command a mockery, if this is not? And nevertheless God must
have given such a command. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116"
href="#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>they maintain that God should
be worshipped for his kindness, saying: If God <i>is</i>, he must be
worshipped; just as they make this inference, the Great Mogul
<i>is</i>, therefore he must be worshipped. His own people do indeed
worship him, but why? assuredly that his unbridled pride and that of
all great men may be gratified, and for no other reason. For he is
worshipped chiefly on account of the fear of his visible power (hence
at his death the worship ceases), and then too on account of the hope
of rewards. This same reason exists for the reverence shown parents and
other people in power; and since invisible powers are considered more
important and greater than visible ones, therefore, they will have it
that still more should they be worshipped. And this God should be
worshipped on account of his love, they say. And what kind of love is
it to expose innocent posterity to infinite suffering on account of the
fall of one man, certainly foreseen and therefore foreordained
(foreordained as far at least as being permitted). But, you say, they
are to be redeemed. But how? The father exposes his only son to extreme
suffering, that he may deliver the other man from tortures no greater,
because of the redemption offered by the former.</p>
<p class="par">The Barbarians had no such silly idea. But why should
God be loved, why worshipped? because he created us? But to what end?
that we should fall! because assuredly he had foreknowledge that [our
progenitors] would fall, and set before them the medium of the
forbidden fruit, without which they could not have fallen. Granted,
however, that he should be worshipped because on him all things depend
for their creation; some, nevertheless, add, for their continued
existence also, and their preservation. Why <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>should God be worshipped? Does he himself
delight in worship? Certainly. Parents and benefactors are honored
among us. But why is this honor given? Human nature has regard for
mutual wants and, the bestowal of honor is due to the idea that we can
be aided by a greater and more enduring power. No one wishes to aid
another unless his own wants are satisfied in turn. That is called a
person&rsquo;s recognition of kindness and gratitude, which demands a
greater recognition of his own kindness; and in order that his
reputation may be spread abroad, it demands that the other be ready, as
a handmaid, so to speak, to inspire in others an idea of his fame and
nobility. Doubtless the idea others may entertain of our ability to be
of service to general or individual needs, tickles us, and raises
plumes for us like those of a peacock, wherefore generosity is found
among the virtues. But who does not see the imperfection of our nature?
Who, however, would say that God, the most perfect of all beings, wants
anything? Or that he wishes for any such thing if he is perfect and
already self-sufficient and honored without any external honors. Who
would say that he wants honor except those who persist in honoring
him?</p>
<p class="par">The desire for honor is a sign of imperfection and lack
of power.</p>
<p class="par">The consensus of opinion among all races on this
subject, is urged by those who have talked with scarcely all even of
their own friends, or have examined three or four books treating of the
testimony of the world, not even carefully considering how far the
authors had knowledge of the customs of the world; but those excellent
authors were not familiar with <i>all</i> customs. Notice, however,
that when one is considering the matter, the objection here arises,
that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>fundamental reasons for worship are connected
with God himself and his works, and not with the elementary
constitution of any society. For there is no one who is not aware that
worship is due to the custom, prevalent among the ruling and rich
classes especially, of maintaining some external form of religion in
order to calm the passions of the people.</p>
<p class="par">But if you are concerned about the former reason, who
would believe that in the principal seat of the Christian
religion,&mdash;Italy,&mdash;there are so many free-thinkers, or to
speak more meaningly, Atheists, and if he should believe it, would say
that there is a consensus of opinion among all races. God <i>is</i>,
therefore should he be worshipped? Because, forsooth, the wiser men at
least say so? Who, pray, are the wiser? The high priest, the augurs,
the soothsayers of the ancients, Cicero, Caesar, the leading men and
their priestly adherents, etc.</p>
<p class="par">Would they let it be known that such practices were to
their interests? Doubtless those in control of public affairs, deriving
their profits from the credulity of the people, told fear-inspiring
stories of the power and vengeance of the invisible gods, and lied
about their own occasional meetings and association with them; and
demanded in proportion to their own luxury beings suitable for or even
surpassing themselves. For it is not to be wondered at that priests
promulgate such teachings, since this is their method of maintaining
their own lives. And such are the teachings of the wiser men.</p>
<p class="par">This world may depend on the control of a prime mover;
this is certainly the fact&mdash;that the dependence will be only at
the start. For why might there not have been a first command of God,
such that everything <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119"
name="pb119">119</a>]</span>would go in a foreordained course to a
fixed end, if he wished to fix one. There would no longer be need of
new care, dependence or support, but he might at first have endowed
every one with sufficient powers. And why should it not be said that he
did this? For it is not to be supposed that he visits all the elements
and parts of the universe as a physician does a sick man.</p>
<p class="par">What then is to be said of the testimony of conscience?
and whence would come those fears of the mind because of wrong-doing,
were it not evident that there is near us a higher power who sees and
punishes us, whom wrong-doing displeases just as it is altogether at
variance with worship of him? It is not now my purpose to inquire more
deeply into the nature of good and evil nor the dangers of prejudice
and the folly of great fear which springs from preconceived ideas. This
merely I say. Whence did they arise? especially since all evil-doing
depends on the corruption and destruction of the harmony resulting from
the interchange of services in the wants to which the human race is
subject, and since the idea about one who wishes to <i>increase</i>
rather than to be of <i>aid</i> in those wants, renders him an object
of hatred. Whence it happens that he himself may fear lest he may incur
the hatred and contempt of others, or a like refusal to satisfy his
wants; or may lose his power of being of service not only to others but
to himself, in so far indeed as he needs to fear any harm from being
wronged by others.</p>
<p class="par">And so, they say, those who do not have the light of
Holy Scriptures, follow the natural light in accordance with the
dictates of their consciences, which proves to be sure, that God has
endowed the intellect of all men with some sparks of his own knowledge
and will, and if they act according to these it must be said
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>that they have done right. For what reason of
theirs can be a command to worship God if this is not? But it is
maintained on many grounds that beasts act according to the guide of
reason, and this matter has not yet been decided; nevertheless I do not
urge this. Who has said anything to you to prove that this does not
occur, or that a trained animal does not at times surpass an ignorant
and uneducated man in intellect and powers of judgment? But to speak to
the point, the majority of men of leisure who have had time to consider
subtile ideas and those beyond the comprehension of the ordinary
intellect, in order to gratify their own pride and promote their own
advantage, have devised many subtile principles for which Alexis and
Thyrsis, prevented by their pastoral and rustic duties, could have had
no leisure. Wherefore, the latter have placed confidence in the
philosophers of leisure, as if they were wiser, while they are more
fitted to impose on the foolish. Hence, good Alexis, go to, worship the
sylvan Pans, Satyrs and Dianas, etc. For the great philosophers will
tell you about the dream of Numa Pompilius, and narrate to you the
story of his concubinage with the nymph Aegeria, and they will wish by
this very account to bind you to his worship, and as a reward for this
pious work, because of the reconciliation and favor of those invisible
powers, they will demand for their own support, the flower of your
flock and your labor as a sacrifice. And hence, since Titius worshipped
Pan, Alexis, the Fauns, Rome, the Gods of War, Athens, the unknown
Gods, is it to be supposed that those good men learned from the light
of reason certain tales which were the idle inventions and ideas of
philosophers? not to attack too harshly the religion of others.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">And why did not this reason also tell that they were
mistaken in their worship, in foolishly worshipping statues and stones,
as if they were the dwelling places of their Gods? But is it indeed to
be supposed that since good women bestowed such worship on Francis,
Ignatius and Dominicus and such men, reason teaches that at least some
one among holy men should be worshipped? That they learn from the light
of nature the worship of some superior power no longer
visible<span class="corr" id="xd21e4359" title="Source: ?">,</span>
although, nevertheless, such are the fabrications of our priests of
leisure for the more splendid increase of their own means of
support.</p>
<p class="par">Therefore, there is no God? Suppose there is (a God.)
Therefore, should he be worshipped? But this does not follow, because
he desires worship as far as he has inscribed it in the heart. What
more then? We should then follow the guide of our nature. But this is
known to be imperfect. In what respects? For is it sufficient enough to
maintain the society of men peacefully? Because other religious people,
following revelation, do not pass more tranquil lives?</p>
<p class="par">But is it rather because God demands of us especially a
more precise idea of God? But nevertheless you who promise this of any
religion whatsoever, do not supply it. For any revelation of what God
is, is far more unintelligible than before. And how will you make this
clearer by the conception of the intellect, since he limits every
intellect?</p>
<p class="par">What do you think of these things?</p>
<p class="par">No one, I say, has a knowledge of God, moreover eye has
not seen him, and he dwells in unapproachable light, and from the time
of revelation till now, in allegory. But I suppose every one knows how
clear an allegory is. Wherefore do you indeed believe that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>God
makes such demands? or is it from the desire of the intellect to
surmount the limitations of its own capacity in order to comprehend
everything more perfectly than it does, or from something else? Who of
you is there who speaks from special revelation? Good God! what a
hodge-podge of revelations. Do you point to the oracles of the heathen?
Antiquity has already held them up to ridicule. To the testimony of
your priests? I can show you priests who will contradict them. You may
protest in your turn, but who will be the judge? Who will put an end to
these disputes? Do you call attention to the writings of Moses, the
Prophets and Apostles? I bring to your notice the Koran, which says
that, according to a new revelation, these are corrupt and its author
boasts of having settled by the sword the corruptions and altercations
of Christians as did Moses those of the heathen. For by the sword
Mahomet and Moses subjugated Palestine, each instructed by great
miracles. And the writings of the Sectarians as well as of the Vedas
and the Brahmins 1300 years back, are in opposition, to say nothing of
the Sinenses.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4373src" href="#xd21e4373"
name="xd21e4373src">1</a> You, who in some remote spot in Europe are
disputing about such things disregard or deny these writings. You
yourself should see very clearly that with equal ease they deny
<i>your</i> writings. And what proofs not miraculous, would be
sufficient to convince the inhabitants of the world, if it were evident
from the first three books of Veda, that the world was contained in and
came from an egg of a scorpion, and that the earth and first elements
of things was placed on the head of a bull, if some envious son of the
Gods had not stolen these first three volumes. In our times this would
be laughed at; and among those people <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>there would not be
this strange argument to establish their religion if it did not have
its origin in the brains of these priests.</p>
<p class="par">And whence else came those many immense volumes
concerning the gods of the pagans and those wagon loads of lies? Moses
acted very wisely in first becoming skilled in the arts of the
Egyptians, that is in the mastery of astrology and magic, and then by
cruel war driving from their homes the petty kings of Palestine, and
pretending a conference like that of Numa Pompilius. Leading his army,
confident of their fortunes, into the possessions of peaceful men; in
order that he, forsooth, might be a great general and his brother high
priest, and that he himself might be a leader and dictator. But of what
a people! Others by milder means and by pulling the wool over the eyes
of the people under cover of profound sanctity (I am afraid to mention
other things,) and by the pious deceits of members of their sect in
secret assemblies, first got control of the ignorant country people and
then, because of the growing strength of the new religion, they got
control of those who feared for themselves, and hated a leader of the
people. At length another eager for war, by feigning miracles attached
to himself the more ferocious people of Asia, who had suffered ill
treatment at the hands of commanders of the Christians, and who, like
Moses, with the promise of many victories and favors, he subjugated the
warring and peaceful leaders of Asia, and established his religion by
the sword. The first is considered the reformer of the heathen, the
second of Judaism and the third the reformer of both. It remains to be
seen who will be the reformer of Mahomet and Mahometanism. Doubtless
then, the credulity of men is likely to be imposed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>on,
and to take advantage of this under the pretense of some gain to be
derived, is rightly called <i>imposture</i>.</p>
<p class="par">It would be too long and tedious to show more at length
in this place, the nature and forms of what goes under the name of
imposture, but we must observe, that, even if natural religion is
granted and the worship of God is right as far as it is said to be
commanded by nature; that up to this time the leader of every new
religion has been suspected of imposture, especially since it is
evident to all and is obvious from what has been said or can be said,
how many deceptions have been used in propagating any religion.</p>
<p class="par">It remains then unanswerable according to the previous
argument, that religion and the worship of God according to the
promptings of natural light, is consistent with truth and justice; but
if any one wishes to establish any new principles in religion, either
new or displeasing, and that by the authority of invisible powers, it
will evidently be necessary for him to show his power of reforming,
unless he wishes to be considered by all an impostor. Since, not under
the conclusions of natural religion, nor under the authority of special
revelation, he offers opposition to the ideas of all. Moreover he
should be so upright in life and character that the people may believe
him worthy of being associated with so high and holy a power, who does
not approve of anything impure. Nor can merely his own confession, nor
the holiness of a past life, nor any miracles&mdash;that is
extraordinary deeds&mdash;prove this; for this is common rather among
the skillful and the deceivers of men, lying hypocrites who pursue
their own advantage and glory in this way. For it is not worth
considering that some reached such a degree of madness that they
voluntarily sought death, in order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125"
href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>that it might be supposed
that they despised and conquered everything, like different ones among
the ancient philosophers. Nor is it to be supposed that they were
upheld by special divine powers in that which they did because of
foolish fancies and fond hopes of mountains of gold, rising from a
defective judgment. For they did not give the matter the proper
consideration, nor did the real teachers, for in order that you may
come to a fair decision about them, I have said not only is their own
testimony not sufficient, but in order to reach the truth of the
matter, they must be compared with one another; and other witnesses
with them, and then their acquaintances and friends, and then
strangers, then friends and enemies; and then after the testimony is
all gathered in, that of each teacher concerning himself, and then that
of others must be compared. And if we do not know the witnesses, we
must consult the witnesses <i>of</i> the witnesses, and so on; besides
instituting an investigation as to <i>your</i> powers of distinguishing
from the true and the false involved in such or other circumstances.
Especially in similar ones, inquiring, moreover, whence you desired
data to learn the truth, for this purpose comparing the judgment of
others, as to what they infer from such an investigation or from the
testimony of witnesses. And from these data it will be permissible to
infer whether he who makes this claim, is a true messenger of the
revelation of divine will and whether his teachings should be gradually
adopted. But at this point we must be very careful not to get into a
circle. Whenever the nature of important religions may be such that one
supplants another, as that of Moses, Paganism, that of Mahomet,
Christianity,&mdash;the later one may not always nor in every
particular cast aside the earlier, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>only in certain
parts, to such an extent that the latter is founded on the former, it
will be necessary to investigate carefully not only either the last, or
the middle, or the first, but all, especially since the charge of
imposture is brought by every sect. So the ancients were charged with
it by Christ, because they corrupted the law; the Christians by
Mahomet, because they corrupted the gospels, a fact not to be wondered
at, inasmuch as one sect of Christians charges the other with
corrupting texts of the New Testament, so that it can [not] be
ascertained whether he who is offered as an example is a teacher of a
true religion or how far those who claim to have been given authority,
should be listened to. For in an investigation no sect must be
overlooked, but each must be compared with the rest without any
prejudice. For if one is overlooked, that perhaps, is the very one
which is nearer the truth. Thus, those who followed Moses, have
followed the truth according to the Christians also, but they ought not
to have paused at that point, but should examine the truth of the
Christian religion also.</p>
<p class="par">Each sect maintains that its own teachers are the best
and that it has had and is daily having proof of this, and that there
are no better ones, so that either every one must believe it, which
would be absurd, or no one, which is the safer plan, until the true way
is known, though no sect should be disregarded in a comparison.</p>
<p class="par">There is no need of presenting the objection that it is
known that all mathematicians agree that twice two is four. For it is
not a similar case, since no one has been known to doubt whether twice
two is four, while on the contrary religions agree neither in end,
beginning nor middle. Suppose that I do not know <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>the
true way of salvation; I follow, however, the Brahmins or the Koran.
Will not Moses and the rest say: What wrong have we done you that you
thus reject us, though we are better and nearer the truth? What reply
shall we make? I believed in Mahomet or the Gymnosophistes<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e4408src" href="#xd21e4408" name=
"xd21e4408src">2</a>, in whose teachings I was born and brought up, and
from them I learned that your religion and that of the Christians which
followed, have long since decayed and grown corrupt, and are still
misleading. Will they not reply that they do not know anything about
the others and that these do not know anything about the true guide to
salvation, since they know that those who are corruptors of the people
are impostors, feigning miracles, or by lies pulling the wool over the
eyes of the people. Nor should faith be thus simply given to one man or
one sect, rejecting all others without a complete and proper
investigation. For with equal right the Ethiopian, who has not left his
own land, says that there are no men under the sun except those of a
black color.</p>
<p class="par">Moreover, this precaution also should be taken in the
investigation of other sects, that equal care should be used in an
investigation of all, and while one is explained with great pains, the
other should not be slighted, because one claim or another at first
sight <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>seems to be wrong, or because of the evil
reports of gossip concerning the leader of that sect, while other
reports are cast aside. For that should not be set down as doctrine or
indubitable testimony, which the first vagabond that comes along
asserts about a hostile religion. Indeed, with equal right on account
of common gossip and the mere mention of a name, the Christian religion
was to some an object of horror, and to others an object of scorn. With
the latter because the Christians worshipped the head of an ass, and
with the former because they ate and drank their God, so that at length
the report became current that to be a Christian was to be a deadly
enemy of God and men; when, nevertheless, such tales were either things
which had been misunderstood or skillfully told lies, which were then
confirmed, and having some foundation, spread abroad because an enemy
of that religion had absolutely no intercourse, or no proper
intercourse, with the Christians themselves, or the more learned among
them, but believed the first ignorant person or deserter or enemy of
that religion. Such a method of investigation being decided upon, it
would always be a matter of great difficulty. What shall we say about
women, what about children, what about the majority of the masses of
the people? All children will be excluded from a feeling of security in
regard to their religion, and the majority of women to whom even those
matters which have been most clearly explained by the leaders of any
religion, as far as can be done, are obscure: also from their manner of
life you rightly perceive that with the exception of a very few
superior ones, they have no accurate powers of comprehending mysteries
of such a character, to say nothing of the countless numbers of
insignificant persons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href=
"#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>and country people for whom the
question of their own support is the most important subject for the
exercise of their powers of reason, while other matters they accept or
reject in good faith. Doubtless there is only a very small part of the
world, who weigh all religions, compare their own carefully with others
and correctly distinguish true reasons from false, in details in which
deception may creep in; but the majority rather adopt the faith of
others, of teachers of sacred matters especially, whose knowledge and
powers of judgment in sacred matters are considered noteworthy.</p>
<p class="par">And so in any religion this is done, especially by those
who can not read and write or do not have anything to read. But it
should have been observed that in this matter it is not sufficient that
the teachers of any religion should have the power, because of very
exact powers of judgment and avowed experience, of distinguishing the
true from the false. Indeed it ought to be very certain to others, with
powers of judgment no less exact, that those teachers have not only the
ability to distinguish the true from the false, but the desire as well,
and indeed we ought to be especially certain that he who professes such
a knowledge and desire is neither deceived nor wishes to be.</p>
<p class="par">And what choice shall we make here among so many
teachers so much at variance in even one eminent sect? For when we look
at our comrades and associates, who disagree on many subjects, although
they are most friendly in other respects, one of the two disputants
will maintain his opinion on account of some defect, either because he
has not a correct understanding of the matter, and lacks the power of
judgment, or because he does not wish to give up, and so does not
desire to confess the truth. But although it might be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>matters of secondary importance in which this
happened, nevertheless the result will be that they will be mistrusted
in other matters also. Each doubtless is in possession of one truth,
and he who gives this up in one place, either from a defect of judgment
or a wrong desire is deservedly mistrusted of doing the same thing in
other cases.</p>
<p class="par">Therefore, that you may judge of the ability and honesty
of any teacher in religion, <i>first</i>, it is necessary for you to be
just as able as he; for otherwise he will be able to impose on you very
easily, and, moreover, if he is unknown to you, he will need the
testimony of others, and these again of others, and so on indefinitely;
not only in regard to his truthfulness, that he really taught such
doctrines, but in regard to his honesty, that he did this without
deceit. And the same method must at once be employed in regard to the
witnesses of his honesty and his teachings. But where will you place an
end to this? It is not enough that such discussions have already taken
place among others; you must consider how well this has been done. For
the ordinary proofs which are set forth are neither conclusive nor
manifest, and prove doubtful matters by others more doubtful, so that,
like those who run in a circle, you return to the starting point.</p>
<p class="par">In order that it may be manifest whether any one is a
teacher of a true religion or an impostor, there is need either of
personal knowledge, which we can not have in the case of the three
great founders of the religions of Judaism, Christianity and
Mahometanism, inasmuch as they lived in far distant places and died
long before our time; or of the knowledge of others, which, if any one
imparts it to you, we call testimony.</p>
<p class="par">Between these, there is still another way of knowing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>any one, namely through his own writings, which
may be called one&rsquo;s own testimony concerning himself. And
concerning Christ, there is no such testimony; concerning Moses, it is
doubtful whether there is; concerning Mahomet, there is the Koran. The
testimony of others is of two classes&mdash;that of friends and that of
enemies. Between these extremes there is no third class, according to
the saying, &ldquo;who is not with me is against me.&rdquo; Mahomet in
his writings assumes and attributes to himself the same divine
qualities as did Moses and another. Moreover the friends of Mahomet and
members of his sect wrote the same things concerning him as did the
members of the sects of the others concerning their masters, and the
enemies of the others wrote just as disparagingly of them as
<i>their</i> friends did of Mahomet. As for the rest, the testimony of
any one concerning himself is too unreliable to inspire implicit
confidence, and is of no consequence except, perchance, to perplex a
thoughtless hearer. The assertions of friends, who doubtless
unanimously repeat the sayings of their masters, are of the same
nature. Nor should the enemies of any one be heeded on account of their
prejudices. But as it is, in spite of these facts, it is for such
trivial reasons, which are confirmed only by the master&rsquo;s own
boasts, the assertions of friends, or the calumnies of enemies, that
every follower of any one of the three assumes that the claims of his
enemy are based wholly on imposture, while the teachings of his master
are founded wholly on truth. Nevertheless Mahomet is undoubtedly
considered an impostor among us; but why? Not from his own testimony or
that of his friends but from that of his enemies. Then, on the
contrary, among the Mahometans he is considered a most holy prophet;
but why? <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>From his own testimony, but especially from that
of his friends. Whoever considers Moses an impostor or a holy teacher
employs the same method of reasoning. And there is equal reason in the
case of Mahomet as in the case of the others, either for charging him
with imposture or for answering that charge, although, nevertheless,
the former are considered holy, while he is considered a scoundrel,
contrary to all the demands of justice. To put it in the scholastic
manner, then, the following conclusions are most firmly established:
Whenever there is the same reason as in the case of Mahomet for
charging any person with imposture or for answering that charge, they
should be placed in the same category. And for example, in the case of
Moses, there is the same reason, therefore justice should be demanded
just as in the case of Mahomet, nor should he be considered an
impostor.</p>
<p class="par">PROOF OF MINOR PREMISE.</p>
<p class="par">(a.) In regard to the rebuttal of the charge of
imposture: this is based on the above-mentioned testimony not only of
Mahomet concerning himself in his well-known writings, but on that of
every one of his friends concerning their master, and hence, it
logically follows:</p>
<p class="par">(I.) Whatever value the testimony of Moses&rsquo;
friends has in defending him on the charge of imposture, the testimony
of Mahomet&rsquo;s friends ought to have the same value. And whatever
the value of the acquittal, though their favorable testimony, etc.,
etc. Therefore, etc.</p>
<p class="par">(II.) And whatever value the books of Moses have for
this purpose, the same value the Koran has also. And so, etc.
Therefore, etc. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Moreover, the Mussulmen, from the very books of the New
Testament (although according to these very persons, these books have
been much corrupted in other respects,) draw various arguments even in
support of their Mahomet, and especially that prediction of Christ
concerning the future Paraclete.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4457src"
href="#xd21e4457" name="xd21e4457src">3</a> They maintain that he came
and exposed the corruption of the Christians, and established a new
covenant. And although at other times the Koran is charged with many
silly, nay impious tales, all these nevertheless, can be explained in a
spiritual sense or smoothed over in other ways, since the rest of the
teachings insist on nothing but extreme sanctity and a stringent mode
of morals, but especially on temperance and abstinence from wine. And
to the objection frequently raised that wine is the gift of God, the
reply can be made that so also are poisons, and yet we are not supposed
to drink them. The further objection often made that the spirit of the
Koran is too carnal, and fills eternal life with pleasures of the world
and the flesh, polygamy moreover being so indiscriminately permitted,
it is not of such weight that it can not be confuted, since Moses also
permitted polygamy and in the New Testament life eternal admits of
banquets, e. g., you will sit down with Abraham and Isaac, etc., etc.
Again, I shall not taste wine except in the Kingdom of my Father. It is
said that all those pleasures mentioned in the Song of Solomon, which
is, of course, also instanced, are not wrong, and when explained in a
spiritual sense imply no wrong, although the same thing is not said of
the Koran. And if we are too severely critical of the words of the
Koran, we ought to employ the same severity of criticism against the
writings of Moses and others. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134"
href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>Moreover the arguments which
are offered from Moses himself in answer to the charge of imposture, do
not seem reasonable nor of sufficient weight.</p>
<p class="par">(I.) Our knowledge of the intercourse Moses had with God
depends on his own testimony and that of his friends, and hence such
evidence can have no more weight than similar arguments of the
Mussulmen concerning the conference that Mahomet had with Gabriel; and
what is more, this intercourse of Moses, according to Moses himself (if
all those sayings are Moses&rsquo;, which are commonly attributed to
him) is open to the suspicion of imposture, as is to be shown
below.</p>
<p class="par">(II.) No one indeed who is acquainted with the many very
grave crimes of Moses, will be able to say easily or at least justly,
that his holiness of life can not easily be matched. His crimes then
are the following:</p>
<p class="par">(a.) Fraud, which none but his friends have palliated,
but they are not impartial judges of the matter; nor does that
commendatory passage of Luke in the Acts of the Apostles form any
apology, for there is dispute as to the honesty and veracity of that
witness.</p>
<p class="par">(b.) The stirring up of rebellion; for it can not be
proved that this was due to a command of God, nay, the contrary is
clear, since elsewhere Moses is urged to forbid resistance to
tyrants.</p>
<p class="par">(c.) Wars, although murder is contrary to the V. and
VII. (?VI.)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4474src" href="#xd21e4474" name=
"xd21e4474src">4</a> commandments of Moses himself, unrestrained
plunder, etc., etc.; just as the high priest in India, or Mahomet in
his land, offering the command of God as a pretext, drove from their
territory the former possessors. Moses slew thousands and gave them
over to slaughter in order to insure salvation to himself and his
people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">(d.) The teaching concerning the taking of the property
of others under the pretense of a loan.</p>
<p class="par">(e.) The prayer to God in which Moses desired to die
eternally for his people, although this petition asked of God such
things as would destroy his essence. See <a class="biblink xd21e43"

<p class="par">(f.) Neglect of the commands of God in regard to

<p class="par">(g.) The chief of Moses&rsquo; crimes, the extreme and

was censured by God himself severely and with the threat of punishment.

name="xd21e4515src">7</a></p>
<p class="par">As to</p>
<p class="par">(b.) The proof of the other argument, namely, the charge
of imposture, it can be said: We believe that Mahomet was an impostor,
not from our personal knowledge, as was pointed out above, but from the
testimony, not of his friends, but of his enemies. But all such are
anti-Mahometans, according to the saying &ldquo;Who is not with me is
against me,&rdquo; etc., etc.: hence follows the conclusion: Whatever
weight the testimony of enemies has in the case of one, that it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>ought to have in the case of the other also.
Otherwise we shall be unjust in condemning one from the testimony of
enemies and not the other; if this were done, all justice would be at
an end.</p>
<p class="par">And in the case of Mahomet, the testimony of enemies has
such weight, that he is considered an Impostor, therefore, etc.,
etc.</p>
<p class="par">Furthermore, I say that reasons for suspecting Moses of
imposture can be elicited not only from external, but from internal
evidence, whereby imposture can be proved by his own testimony as well
as by that of others, albeit, his followers, although there is still
dispute.</p>
<p class="par">(I.) Whether the books, which are said to be those of
Moses, are his or (II.) those of compilers, (III.) or those of Esdras,
especially, and (IV.) whether they were written in the Samaritan, or
(V.) the real Hebrew language; and (VI.) if the latter, whether we can
understand that language. All these matters are doubtful for many
reasons, and especially it can be shown from the first chapters of
Genesis that we can not correctly interpret that language. I confess I
am unwilling to concern myself with these points, but I wish to discuss
the man.</p>
<p class="par">I. From Moses&rsquo; own testimony and indeed</p>
<p class="par">(a.) concerning his life and character which we have
considered above, and which, if any blame is attached to Mahomet on
account of the fierce wars he waged, especially against the innocent,
is equally blamable, and in other respects does not seem at all
different from Mahomet&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="par">(b.) Concerning the authority of his own teaching. And
here applies what was said above about Moses&rsquo; intercourse with
God, which Moses indeed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>boasted of but evidently with too
great exaggeration. For if any one boasts of intercourse with God of an
impossible nature, his intercourse is properly doubted and Moses, etc.
Therefore, etc. It is proved because he boasts of having seen that of
which in the Old and in the New Testament afterward, it is very often
said that no eye has seen (namely) God face to face. <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex%2032:11">Exodus xxxii.
11</a>. <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=

8</a>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4549src" href="#xd21e4549" name=
"xd21e4549src">8</a> Thus he saw God (1) in his own form, not in a
vision nor in a dream (2), but face to face as friend to friend when he
spoke directly to him. But any vision, which (1) is like that of
friends speaking face to face, directly to one another, (2) like that
of the blessed in the other life, is properly called and considered a
vision of God. And Moses, etc. Therefore, etc. The <i>Minor premise</i>
is proved from the passages previously cited and from the words of the
Apostle: then indeed face to face, etc., and there is the same argument
in the passages of Moses and in that of the Apostle. And yet among
Christians the belief is most firmly established that no unjust person
can see God in this life. And in the above passage of <a class=
"biblink xd21e43" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ex%2033:20">Exodus
xxxiii. 20</a>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4570src" href="#xd21e4570"
name="xd21e4570src">9</a> it is expressly added: you will not be able
to see my face. These words God addressed to Moses and they are in
direct contradiction to the passages previously cited, so that these
claims can be explained in no other way than by saying that they were
added by a thoughtless compiler, but by so doing the whole is rendered
doubtful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">(c.) Concerning the teachings of Moses, which relate
either to the laws or the gospel. Among the laws, all of which for the
sake of brevity I can not now consider, the decalogue is most
important, being called the special work of God and said to have been
written on Mount Horeb. But it is evident it was devised by Moses
before it was written by God, because these commands are not in
themselves characterized by the perfection of God, since (1) they are
either superfluous, namely the last three, arguing from the words of
Christ in <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt%205">Math.
v</a>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4583src" href="#xd21e4583" name=
"xd21e4583src">10</a> undoubtedly relating to the former, while the IX
should not be separated from the X, and they will likewise be
superfluous (2) or they are defective. For where are these
commandments: thou shalt not desire to have other Gods, nor desire to
curse God, nor desire to desecrate the Sabbath, nor to injure thy
parents, and similar ones? And is it to be presumed that God would
forbid the lesser sins of coveting a neighbor&rsquo;s house, land and
property especially, and in an order so extraordinary, and not the
greater? As to the teaching of Moses concerning the gospel, he
establishes a very foolish and untrustworthy sign of the future great
prophet, or Christ. <a class="biblink xd21e43" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deut%2018%2021-22">Deut.
xviii, 21, 22</a>,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4593src" href=
"#xd21e4593" name="xd21e4593src">11</a> since this sign makes faith
impossible for a long time. From this dictum it follows that Christ,
having predicted the fall of Jerusalem, ought not to have been
considered a true prophet while that prophecy was as yet unfulfilled
(nor should Daniel, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"
name="pb139">139</a>]</span>until his prophecy had been fulfilled), and
so those who lived in the interval between the time of Christ and the
overthrow of Judea, can not be blamed for not believing in him,
although Paul hurled anathemas at those who did not attach themselves
to Christ before the fall.</p>
<p class="par">Whatever sign, then, permits people for a long time to
believe what they please with impunity, can not proceed from God, but
is justly subject to suspicion. And this sign was given, etc.,
therefore, etc.</p>
<p class="par">What is said concerning the fulfillment of other
prophecies is no objection. For it is the special and genuine sign of
that great prophet, that his predictions are fulfilled. Wherefore,
naturally, previous to this fulfillment he could not have been
considered such a prophet.</p>
<p class="par">The other absurd conclusion which evidently follows from
this passage, is this: that although this sign ought to have been the
proof of the divine inspiration of all prophets, in the case of certain
prophets who made predictions, indefinite indeed, but in words not
admitting a moral interpretation (such as soon, swiftly, near, etc.,)
that sign can by no means be found, e. g. Many predict the last day of
the world and Peter said that that day was at hand; therefore, so far,
until it comes it will be impossible to consider him a true
prophet.</p>
<p class="par">For such is the express requirement Moses makes in the
passage cited.</p>
<p class="par">(d.) Concerning the histories of Moses. But if the Koran
is charged with containing many fables, doubtless in Genesis there are
many stories to arouse the suspicions of the thoughtful reader: as the
creation of man from the dust of the earth, the inspiration of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>the breath of life, the creation of Eve from the
rib of the man, serpents speaking and seducing human beings, who were
very wise and well aware that the serpent was possessed by the father
of lies, the eating of an apple which was to bring punishment upon the
whole world, which would make finite one of the attributes of God,
namely his clemency (the attributes of God being identical with his
essence), as the redemption of the fallen would make finite the wrath
of God, and so God himself: for the wrath of God is God himself; men
eight or nine hundred years old; the passage of the animals into the
ark of Noah, the tower of Babel, the confusion of tongues, etc., etc.
These and a thousand other stories can not fail to impress the
investigating freethinker as being similar to the fables, especially of
the Rabbins since the Jewish race is very much addicted to the use of
fables; nor at all inconsistent with other works, to mention those of
Ovid, the Vedas, those of the Sinenses and the Brahmins of India, who
tell that a beautiful daughter born from an egg bore the world, and
similar absurdities. But Moses especially seems to arrest our attention
because he represents God as contradicting himself, namely, saying that
all things were good and yet that it was not good for Adam to be alone.
Whence it follows that there was something apart from Adam that was not
good and so could injure the good condition of Adam, while,
nevertheless, the solitude of Adam itself was the work of God, since he
had created goodness not only of the essences but also of the
qualities.</p>
<p class="par">For all things were good in that quality in which God
had created them. I adduce as proof: It is impossible for any work
created by God not to be good. And the solitude of Adam, etc., etc.
Therefore, etc. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141"
name="pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Whoever enters upon the study of the genealogies of the
Old Testament finds many difficulties in Moses. I shall not now cite
all, contenting myself with merely this one example, since Paul, I.
Tim. i., 4,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e4629src" href="#xd21e4629" name=
"xd21e4629src">12</a> has taught that genealogies are useless, and the
study of them unprofitable, nay, to be avoided. Of what use were so
many separate, nay, so oft times repeated, genealogies? And there is a
remarkable example to arouse suspicion at least of the corruption of
the text or of the carelessness of compilers, in the case of the wives
of Esau and the different things said of them.</p>

*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DE TRIBUS IMPOSTORIBUS, A. D. 1230 ***

***** This file should be named 50715-h.htm or 50715-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
